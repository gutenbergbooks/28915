<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This fifth volume of the Zigzag books, in which
history is taught by a supposed tour of interesting
places, might be called a German story-book.</p>

<p>It was the aim of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Zigzag Journeys in Europe</span>&rdquo;
and &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Zigzag Journeys in Classic Lands</span>&rdquo; to
make history interesting by stories and pictures of places. It was the
purpose of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Zigzag Journeys in the Orient</span>&rdquo; to explain the Eastern
Question, and of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Zigzag Journeys in the Occident</span>&rdquo; to explain
Homesteading in the West.</p>

<p>The purpose of this volume is the same as in &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Europe</span>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Classic Lands</span>.&rdquo; A light narrative of travel takes the reader to the
places most conspicuously associated with German history, tradition,
literature, and art, and in a disconnected way gives a view of the most
interesting events of those Northern countries that once constituted a
great part of the empire of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>It is the aim of these books to stimulate a love of history, and to
<em>suggest</em> the best historical reading. To this end popular stories and
pictures are freely used to adapt useful information to the tastes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the young. But in every page, story, and picture, right education and
right influence are kept in view.</p>

<p>In this volume many German legends and fairy stories have been
used, but they are so introduced and guarded as not to leave a wrong
impression upon the minds of the young and immature.</p>

<span class="tinyfont">IN</span><br />
NORTHERN LANDS.</h1>



<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE RIVER OF STORY AND SONG.</h3>


<p><span class="dcaptlrg"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE Rhine! River of what histories, tragedies,
comedies, legends, stories, and songs! Associated
with the greatest events of the history of
Germany, France, and Northern Europe; with
the Rome of C&aelig;sar and Aurelian; with the
Rome of the Popes; with the Reformation;
with the shadowy goblin lore and beautiful fairy
tales of the twilight of Celtic civilization that
have been evolved through centuries and have
become the household stories of all enlightened
lands!</p>

<p>A journey down the Rhine is like passing
through wonderland; wild stories, quaint stories,
legendary and historic stories, are associated with
every rood of ground from the Alps to the ocean.
It is a region of the stories of two thousand years. The Rhine is the
river of the poet; its banks are the battle-fields of heroes; its forests
and villages the fairy lands of old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
When Rome was queen of the world, C&aelig;sar carried his eagles
over the Rhine; Titus sent a part of his army which had conquered
Jerusalem to the Rhine; Julian erected a fortress on the Rhine; and
Valentinian began the castle-building that was to go on for a thousand
years.</p>

<p class="caption">INTRODUCING CHRISTIANITY INTO THE NORTH.</p>

<p>The period of the Goths, Huns, Celts, and Vandals came,&mdash;the
conquerors of Rome; and the Rhine was strewn with Roman ruins.
Charlemagne cleared away the ruins, and began anew the castle-building.
A Christian soldier in one of the legions that destroyed Jerusalem
and tore down the temple, first brought the Gospel to the
Rhine. His name was Crescaitius. He was soon followed by missionaries
of the Cross. Christianity was established upon the Rhine
soon after it entered Rome.</p>

<p class="caption">CASTLE IN RHINE LAND.</p>

<p>The great conquests of modern history are directly or indirectly
associated with the wonderful river; C&aelig;sar, who conquered the world,
crossed the Rhine; Attila, who conquered the city of the C&aelig;sars;
Clovis, who founded the Christian religion in France; and Charlemagne,
who established the Christian church in Germany. Frederick

Barbarossa and Frederick the Great added lustre to its growing history,
and Napoleon gave a yet deeper coloring to its thrilling scenes.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">TOWER OF R&Uuml;DESHEIM ON THE RHINE.</p>

<p>When the Northern nations shattered the Roman power, people
imagined that the dismantled castles of the Rhine became the abodes
of mysterious beings: spirits of the rocks, forests, fens; strange
maidens of the red marshes; enchanters, demons; the streams were
the abodes of lovely water nymphs; the glens of the woods, of delightful
fairies.</p>

<p>Into these regions of shadow, mystery, of heroic history, of moral
conflicts and Christian triumphs, it is always interesting to go. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
especially interesting to the American traveller, for his form of Christianity
and republican principles came from the Rhine. Progress to
him was cradled on the Rhine, like Moses on the Nile. In the Rhine
lands Luther taught, and Robinson of Leyden lived and prayed; and
from those lands to-day comes the great emigration that is peopling
the golden empire of America in the West. &ldquo;I would be proud of the
Rhine were I a German,&rdquo; said Longfellow. &ldquo;I love rivers,&rdquo; said
Victor Hugo; &ldquo;of all rivers I prefer the Rhine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is our purpose in this story-telling volume to relate why the
Zigzag Club was led to make the Rhine the subject of its winter
evening study, and to give an account of an excursion that some of
its members had made from Constance to Rotterdam and into the
countries of the North Sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>GHOST STORIES.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">The Zigzag Club again.&mdash;Some &ldquo;Ghost&rdquo; Stories.</p>


<p><span class="dcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE Academy had opened again. September again
colored the leaves of the old elms of Yule. The
Blue Hills, as lovely as when the Northmen beheld
them nearly nine hundred years ago, were radiant
with the autumn tinges of foliage and sky, changing
from turquoise to sapphire in the intense twilight,
and to purple as the shades of evening fell.</p>

<p>The boys were back again, all except the graduating class, some
of whom were at Harvard, Brown, and Yale. Master Lewis was in
his old place, and Mr. Beal was again his assistant.</p>

<p>The Zigzag Club was broken by the final departure of the graduating
class. But Charlie Leland, William Clifton, and Herman
Reed, who made a journey on the Rhine under the direction of Mr.
Beal, had returned, and they had been active members of the school
society known as the Club.</p>

<p>We should say here, to make the narrative clear to those who have
not read &ldquo;Zigzag Journeys in Classic Lands&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zigzag Journeys
in the Orient,&rdquo; that the boys of the Academy of Yule had been accustomed
each year to form a society for the study of the history, geography,
legends, and household stories of some chosen country, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
during the long summer vacation as many of the society as could do
so, visited, under the direction of their teachers, the lands about which
they had studied. This society was called the Zigzag Club, because
it aimed to visit historic places without regard to direct routes of
travel. It zigzagged in its travels from the associations of one historic
story to another, and was influenced by the school text-book or
the works of some pleasing author, rather than the guide-book.</p>

<p>The Zigzag books have been kindly received;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and we may here
remark parenthetically that they do not aim so much to present narratives
of travel as the histories, traditions, romances, and stories of
places. They seek to tell stories at the places where the events occurred
and amid the associations of the events that still remain. The
Zigzag Club go seeking what is old rather than what is new, and thus
change the past tense of history to the present tense.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> More than one hundred thousand volumes have been sold.</p>
</div>

<p>Charlie Leland was seated one day on the piazza of the Academy,
after school, reading Hawthorne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Twice-Told Tales.&rdquo; Master
Lewis presently took a seat beside him; and &ldquo;Gentleman Jo,&rdquo; whom
we introduced to our readers in &ldquo;Zigzags in the Occident,&rdquo; was resting
on the steps near them.</p>

<p>Gentleman Jo was the janitor. He was a relative of Master
Lewis, and a very intelligent man. He had been somewhat disabled
in military service in the West, and was thus compelled to accept a
situation at Yule that was quite below his intelligence and personal
worth. The boys loved and respected him, sought his advice often,
and sometimes invited him to meetings of their Society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you called together the Club yet?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis
of Charlie, when the latter had ceased reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had an informal meeting in my room last evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your plan of study?&rdquo;</p>

agreed to relate historic <em>ghost stories</em>. We asked Tommy Toby to be
present, and he promised to give us for the occasion his version of
&lsquo;St. Dunstan and the Devil and the Six Boy Kings.&rsquo; I hardly know
what the story is about, but the title sounds interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you choose ghost stories?&rdquo; asked Master Lewis,
curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You gave us Irving and Hawthorne to read in connection with
our lessons on American literature. &lsquo;Rip Van Winkle,&rsquo; &lsquo;Sleepy Hollow,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Twice-Told Tales&rsquo; turned our thoughts to popular superstitions;
and, as they made me chairman, I thought it an interesting
subject just now to present to the Club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More interesting than profitable, I am thinking. Still, the subject
might be made instructive and useful as well as amusing.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;Did you ever see a ghost?&rdquo; asked Charlie of Gentleman Jo, after
Master Lewis left them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought we had one in our house, when I was living with my
sister in Hingham, before the war. Hingham used to be famous for
its ghost stories; an old house without its ghost was thought to lack
historic tone and finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gentleman Jo took a story-telling attitude, and a number of the
pupils gathered around him.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">GENTLEMAN JO&rsquo;S GHOST STORY.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>I shall never forget the scene of excitement, when one morning Biddy, our
domestic, entered the sitting-room, her head bobbing, her hair flying, and her
cap perched upon the top of her head, and exclaimed: &ldquo;Wurrah! I have seen
a ghoust, and it&rsquo;s lave the hoose I must. Sich a night! I&rsquo;d niver pass anither
the like of it for the gift o&rsquo; the hoose. Bad kick to ye, an&rsquo; the hoose is haunted
for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Biddy, what have you seen?&rdquo; asked my sister, in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seen? An&rsquo; sure I didn&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo;. I jist shet me eyes and hid mesilf
under the piller. But it was awful. An&rsquo; the way it clanked its chain! O murther!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
This last remark was rather startling. Spirits that clank their chains have
a very unenviable reputation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said my uncle. &ldquo;What you heard was nothing but rats.&rdquo; Then,
turning to me, he asked: &ldquo;Where is the steel trap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stolen, I think,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I set it day before
yesterday, and when I went to look to it it was gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; will ye be givin&rsquo; me the wages?&rdquo; said
Biddy, &ldquo;afore I bid ye good-marnin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going?&rdquo; asked my sister, in astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; sure I am,&rdquo; answered Biddy. &ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;d be afther stayin&rsquo; in a house that&rsquo;s haunted,
do ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes I heard the front door bang,
and, looking out, saw our late domestic, with a budget
on each arm, trudging off as though her ideas were of
a very lively character.</p>

<p>A colored woman, recently from the South, took
Biddy&rsquo;s place that very day, and was assigned the
same room in which the latter had slept.</p>

<p>We had invited company for that evening, and
some of the guests remained to a very late hour.</p>

<p>The sound of voices subsided as one after another
departed, and we were left quietly chatting with
the few who remained. Suddenly there was a mysterious
movement at one of the back parlor doors, and
we saw two white eyes casting furtive glances into the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo; demanded my sister, of the
object at the door.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;I&rsquo;VE SEEN DE DEBBLE.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Our new domestic appeared in her night clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O missus, I&rsquo;ve seen de debble, I done have,&rdquo; was her first exclamation.</p>

<p>This, certainly, was not a sight that we should wish any one to see in our
house, as desirable as a dignified spectre might have been.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said my sister. &ldquo;What a silly creature! Go back to bed and to
sleep, and do not shame us by appearing before company in your night clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t keer nothing about my night clothes,&rdquo; she replied, with spirit.
&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; go to de room and git de things dat belong to me, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll leave, and never
disturb you nor dis house any more. It&rsquo;s dreadful enough to be visited by dead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
folks, any way, but when de spirits comes rattling a chain it&rsquo;s a dreadful bad
sign, you may be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo; asked I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See? I didn&rsquo;t see nothin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Twas bad enough to hear it. I wouldn&rsquo;t
hav&rsquo; seen it for de world. I&rsquo;ll go quick&mdash;jest as soon as you gets de things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We made her a bed on a lounge below stairs. The next morning she took
her bundles and made a speedy exit.</p>

<p>We had a maiden aunt who obtained a livelihood by visiting her relations.
On the morning when our last domestic left she arrived, bag and baggage, greatly
to our annoyance. We said nothing about the disturbances to her, but agreed
among ourselves that she should sleep in the haunted chamber.</p>

<p>That night, about twelve o&rsquo;clock, the household were awakened by a piercing
scream above stairs. All was silent for a few minutes, when the house echoed
with the startling cry of &ldquo;Murder! Mur<em>der</em>! Mur<span class="smcap">der</span>!&rdquo; The accent was very
strong on the last syllable in the last two words, as though the particular force
of the exclamation
was
therein contained.</p>

<p>I hurried
to the chamber
and asked
at the door
what was the
matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have
seen an apparatus,&rdquo;
exclaimed
my
aunt. &ldquo;Mur<em>der</em>! Oh, wait a minute. I&rsquo;m a dead woman.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>She unlocked the door in a delirious way and descended to the sitting-room,
where she sat sobbing for a long time, declaring that she was a dead woman.
<em>She</em> had heard his chain rattle.</p>

<p>And the next morning she likewise left.</p>

<p>We now felt uneasy ourselves, and wondered what marvel the following night
would produce. I examined the room carefully during the day, but could discover
no traces of anything unusual.</p>

<p>That night we were again awakened by noises that proceeded from the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
room. They seemed like the footfalls of a person whose feet were clad in iron.
Then followed sounds like a scuffle.</p>

<p>I rose, and, taking a light, went to the chamber with shaky knees and a palpitating
heart. I listened before the door. Presently there was a movement in
the room as of some one dragging a chain. My courage began to ebb. I was
half resolved to retreat at once, and on the morrow advise the family to quit the
premises.</p>

<p>But my better judgment at last prevailed, and, opening the door with a nervous
hand, I saw an &ldquo;apparatus&rdquo; indeed.</p>

<p>Our old cat, that I had left accidentally in the room, had in her claws a large
rat, to whose leg was attached the missing trap, and to the trap a short chain.</p>
</div>

<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;I knew the story would end in that way,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;But that
is not a true colonial ghost story, if it did happen in old Hingham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun was going down beyond the Waltham Hills. The shadows
of the maples were lengthening upon the lawns, and the chirp
of the crickets was heard in the old walls. Charlie seemed quite dissatisfied
with Gentleman Jo&rsquo;s story. The latter noticed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My story does not please you?&rdquo; said Gentleman Jo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I am in a different mood to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Master Lewis smiled.</p>

<p>Just then a quiet old lady, who had charge of a part of the rooms
in the Academy, appeared, a bunch of keys jingling by her side, much
like the wife of a porter of a lodge in an English castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother Golden,&rdquo; said Charlie,&mdash;the boys were accustomed
to address the chatty, familiar old lady in this way,&mdash;&ldquo;you have seen
ghosts, haven&rsquo;t you? What is the most startling thing that ever happened
in your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandmother Golden had seated herself in one of the easy piazza
chairs. After a few minutes she was induced to follow Gentleman Jo
in an old-time story.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="smlpadt">GRANDMOTHER GOLDEN&rsquo;S ONLY GHOST STORY.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The custom in old times, when a person died, was for some one to sit in the
room and watch with the dead body in the night, as long as it remained in the
house. A good, pious custom it
was, in my way of thinking,
though it is not common now.</p>

<p>Jemmy Robbin was a poor
old man. They used to call him
&ldquo;Auld Robin Gray,&rdquo; after the
song, and he lived and died alone.
His sister Dorothea&mdash;Dorothy
she was commonly called&mdash;took
charge of the house after his
death, and she sent for Grandfather
Golden to watch one night
with the corpse.</p>

<p>We were just married, grandfather
and I, and he wanted I
should watch with him, for company;
and as I could not bear
that he should be out of my sight
a minute when I could help it,
I consented. I was young and
foolish then, and very fond of
grandfather,&mdash;we were in our
honeymoon, you know.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t go to the house at
a very early hour of the evening;
it wasn&rsquo;t customary for the watchers
to go until it was nearly time
for the family to retire.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class="caption">GRANDMOTHER GOLDEN.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>In the course of the evening
there came to the house a traveller,&mdash;a poor Irishman,&mdash;an old man, evidently
honest, but rather simple, who asked Dorothy for a lodging.</p>

<p>He said he had travelled far, was hungry, weary, and footsore, and if turned
away, knew not where he could go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
It was a stormy night, and the good heart of Dorothy was touched at the
story of the stranger, so she told him that he might stay.</p>

<p>After he had warmed himself and eaten the food she prepared for him, she
asked him to retire, saying that she expected company. Instead of going with
him to show where he was to sleep, as she ought to have done, she directed him
to his room, furnished him with a light, and bade him good-night.</p>

<p>The Irishman, as I have said, was an old man and not very clear-headed.
Forgetting his directions, and mistaking the room, he entered the chamber where
lay the body of poor Jemmy Robbin. In closing the door the light was blown
out. He found there was what seemed to be some other person in the bed, and,
supposing him a live bedfellow, quietly lay down, covered himself with a counterpane,
and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>About ten o&rsquo;clock grandfather and I entered the room. We just glanced at
the bed. What seemed to be the corpse lay there, as it should. Then grandfather
sat down in an easy-chair, and I, like a silly hussy, sat down in his lap.</p>

<p>We were having a nice time, talking about what we would do and how
happy we should be when we went to housekeeping, when, all at once, I heard
a snore. It came from the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That?&rdquo; said grandfather. &ldquo;Mercy! that was Jemmy Robbin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We listened nervously, but heard nothing more, and at last concluded that
it was the wind that had startled us. I gave grandfather a generous kiss, and
it calmed his agitation wonderfully.</p>

<p>We grew cheerful, laughed at our fright, and were chatting away again as
briskly as before, when there was a noise in bed. We were silent in a moment.
The counterpane certainly moved. Grandfather&rsquo;s eyes almost started from his
head. The next instant there was a violent sneeze.</p>

<p>I jumped as if shot. Grandfather seemed petrified. He attempted to
ejaculate something, but was scared by the sound of his own voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; says I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; said grandfather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and call Dorothy,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would be frightened out of her senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall die with fright if I hear anything more,&rdquo; I said, half dead already
with fear.</p>

<p>Just then a figure started up in the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wha&mdash;and wha&mdash;and wha&mdash;&rdquo; mumbled the object, gesticulating.</p>

<p>I sprang for the door, grandfather after me, and, reaching the bottom of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
stairs at one bound, gave vent to my terrors by a scream,
that, for aught I know, could have been heard a mile distant.</p>

<p>Both of us ran for Dorothy&rsquo;s room. There was a
sound of feet and a loud ejaculation of &ldquo;Holy Peter!
The man is dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; shouted grandfather, and, sure enough,
there were footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dorothy! Dorothy!&rdquo; I screamed.
Dorothy, startled from her
sleep, came rushing to the entry in
her night-dress.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a ghost, Dorothy,&rdquo;
said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen the awfullest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said grandfather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holy Peter!&rdquo; said an object in the
darkness. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dead man in the
bed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s that Irishman,&rdquo; said Dorothy,
as she heard the voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Irishman?&rdquo; asked I. &ldquo;A
murdered one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he&mdash;there&mdash;I suspect that
he mistook his room and went to bed
with poor Jemmy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mystery now became quite clear. Grandfather looked anything but
pleased, and declared that he would rather have seen a ghost than to have been
so foolishly frightened.</p>
</div>

<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Charlie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; said Grandmother Golden. &ldquo;Just hear the crickets
chirp. Sounds dreadful mournful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been twice disappointed,&rdquo; said Charlie. &ldquo;Perhaps, Master
Lewis, you can tell us a story before we go in. Something fine and
historic.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
&ldquo;In harmony with books you are reading?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the spirit of Nature,&rdquo; added Charlie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fine that there boy talks,&rdquo; said Grandmother Golden. &ldquo;Get
to be a minister some day, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would the <em>True</em> Story of Macbeth answer?&rdquo; asked Master
Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be excellent: Shakspeare. The greatest ghost story
ever written.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll just wait and hear that story, too,&rdquo;
said good-humored Grandmother Golden.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">MASTER LEWIS&rsquo;S STORY OF MACBETH.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>More than eight hundred years ago, when the Roman wall divided England
from Scotland, when the Scots and Picts had become one people, and when the
countries of Northern Europe were disquieted by the ships of the Danes, there
was a king of the Scots, named Duncan. He was a very old man, and long,
long after he was dead, certain writers discovered that he was a very good man.
He had two sons, named Malcolm and Donaldbain.</p>

<p>Now, when Duncan was enfeebled by years, a great fleet of Danes, under
the command of Suene, King of Denmark and Norway, landed an army on the
Scottish coast. Duncan was unable to take the field against the invaders in
person, and his sons were too young for such a trust. He had a kinsman, who
had proved himself a brave soldier, named Macbeth. He placed this kinsman
at the head of his troops; and certain writers, long, long after the event, discovered
that this kinsman appointed a relation of his own, named Banquo, to assist
him. Macbeth and Banquo defeated the Danes in a hard-fought battle, and then
set out for a town called Forres to rest and to make merry over their victory.</p>

<p>A thane was the governor of a province. The father of Macbeth was the
thane of Glamis.</p>

<p>There lived at Forres three old women, whom the people believed to be
witches. When these old women heard that Macbeth was coming to the place
they went out to meet him, and awaited his coming on a great heath. The first
old woman saluted him on his approach with these words: &ldquo;All hail, Macbeth&mdash;hail
to thee, thane of Glamis!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the second: &ldquo;All hail, Macbeth&mdash;hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
And the third: &ldquo;All hail, Macbeth&mdash;thou shalt be king of Scotland!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macbeth was very much astonished at these salutations; he expected to
become thane of Glamis some day, and he aspired to be king of Scotland, but
he had never anticipated such a disclosure of his destiny as this. The old
women told Banquo that he would become the father of kings, and then they
vanished, according to Shakspeare, &ldquo;into the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macbeth and Banquo rode on very much elevated in spirits, when one met
them who informed them that the thane of Glamis was dead. The melancholy
event was not unwelcome to Macbeth; his spirits rose to a still higher pitch;
one thing that the old women had foretold had speedily come to pass,&mdash;he was
indeed thane of Glamis.</p>

<p>As Macbeth drew near the town, a glittering court party came out to welcome
the army. They hailed Macbeth as thane of Cawdor. He was much
surprised at this, and asked the meaning. They told him that the thane of
Cawdor had rebelled, and that the king had bestowed the province upon him.
Macbeth was immensely delighted at this intelligence, feeling quite sure that
the rest of the prophecy would come to pass, and that he would one day wear
the diadem.</p>

<p>Now the wife of Macbeth was a very wicked woman, and the prophecy of
the witches quite turned her head, so that she could think of nothing but becoming
queen. She was much concerned lest the nature of her husband should
prove &ldquo;too full of the milk of human kindness&rdquo; to come to the &ldquo;golden round.&rdquo;
So she decided that should an opportunity offer itself for an interview with the
king, she would somewhat assist in the fulfilment of the last prophecy.</p>

<p>Then Macbeth made a great feast in the grand old castle of Inverness, and
invited the king. Lady Macbeth thought this a golden opportunity for accomplishing
the decrees of destiny, and when the old king arrived she told Macbeth
that the time had come for him to strike boldly for the crown. As Shakspeare
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Macbeth.</i> My dearest love, Duncan comes here to-night.</p>

<p><i>Lady M.</i> And when goes hence?</p>

<p><i>Macbeth.</i> To-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Lady M.</i> O never shall sun that morrow see.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>When this dreadful woman had laid her plot for the taking off of Duncan,
she went to the banquet-hall and greeted the royal guest with a face all radiant
with smiles, and called him sweet names, and told him fine stories, and brimmed
his goblet with wine, so that he thought, we doubt not, that she was the most
charming creature in all the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
It was a stormy night, that of the banquet; it rained, it thundered, and
the wind made dreadful noises in the forests, which events, we have noticed in
the stories of the old writers, were apt to occur in early times when something
was about to happen. We are also informed that the owls
hooted, which seems probable, as owls were quite plenty in
those days.</p>

<p>Duncan was conducted to a chamber, which had been
prepared for him in great state, when the feast was done.
Before retiring he sent to &ldquo;his most kind hostess&rdquo;
a large diamond as a present; he then fell
asleep &ldquo;in measureless content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When all was still in the
castle Lady Macbeth told her
husband that the hour for the
deed had come. He hesitated, and
reminded her of the consequences
if he should fail. She taunted him
as being a coward, and told him to
&ldquo;screw his courage up to the sticking-place,
and he would not fail.&rdquo;
Then he took his dagger, and, according
to Shakspeare, made a long
speech over it, a speech which, I
am sorry to say, stage-struck boys
and girls have been mouthing in a
most unearthly manner ever since the days of Queen Bess.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Macbeth &ldquo;screwed his courage up to the sticking-place&rdquo; indeed, and then
and there was the end of the life of Duncan. When the deed was done, he put
his poniard into the hand of a sentinel, who was sleeping in the king&rsquo;s room,
under the influence of wine that Lady Macbeth had drugged.</p>

<p class="caption">WITCHES.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>When the meal was prepared on the following morning, Macbeth and his
lady pretended to be much surprised that the old king did not get up. Macduff,
the thane of Fife, who was one of the royal party, decided at last to go to the
king&rsquo;s apartment to see if the king was well. He returned speedily in great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"><!-- illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
excitement, as one may well suppose. As Shakspeare continues the interesting
narrative:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Macduff.</i> O horror! horror! horror!</p>

<p><i>Macbeth.</i> What&rsquo;s the matter?</p>

<p><i>Macd.</i> Confusion now hath made his masterpiece. Most sacrilegious murder hath broke
ope the Lord&rsquo;s anointed temple and stole thence the life o&rsquo; the building.</p>

<p><i>Macb.</i> What is &rsquo;t you say? the life?&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Macbeth appeared to be greatly shocked by the event, and, with a great show
of fury and many hot words, he despatched the sentinels of the king, whom he
feigned to believe had done the deed. Lady Macbeth fell upon the floor, pretending,
of all things in the world for a woman of such mettle, to faint.</p>

<p>So Macbeth came to the throne. But he remembered that the weird women
had foretold that Banquo should become the father of kings, which made him
fear for the stability of his throne. He thought to correct the tables of destiny
somewhat, and so he induced two desperate men to do by Banquo as he had
done by Duncan. The spirit of Banquo was not quiet like Duncan&rsquo;s, but haunted
him, and twice appeared to him at a great feast that he gave to the thanes.</p>

<p>Now Banquo had a son named Fleance, whom the murderers were instructed
to kill, but who, on the death of his father, eluded his enemies and fled to France.
The story-writers say that the line of Stuart was descended from this son.</p>

<p>Macbeth, like all wicked people who accomplish their ends, was very unhappy.
He lived in continual fear lest some of his relations should do by him as he had
done by Duncan and Banquo. He became so miserable at last that he decided
to consult the witches who had foretold his elevation, to hear what they would
say of the rest of his life.</p>

<p>He found them in a dark cave, in the middle of which was a caldron boiling.
The old women had put into the pot a toad, the toe of a frog, the wool of a bat,
an adder&rsquo;s tongue, an owl&rsquo;s wing, and many other things, of which you will find
the list in Shakspeare. Now and then they walked around the pot, repeating a
very sensible ditty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Double, double, toil and trouble;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire, burn; and, caldron, bubble.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>They at last called up an apparition, who said that Macbeth should never be
overcome by his enemies until Birnam wood should come to the castle of Dunsinane,
the royal residence, to attack it.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Macbeth shall never vanquished be until<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall come against him.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Now, Birnam wood was twelve miles from Dunsinane (pronounced Dunsnan),
and Macbeth thought that the language was a mystical way of saying that he
always would be exempt from danger.</p>

<p>Malcolm, the son of Duncan, the rightful heir to the throne, was a man of
spirit, and he went to England to solicit aid of the good King Edward the Confessor
against Macbeth. Macduff, having quarrelled with the king, joined Malcolm,
and the English king, thinking favorably of their cause, sent a great army
into Scotland to discrown Macbeth.</p>

<p>When this army reached Birnam wood, on its way to Dunsinane, Macduff
ordered the men each to take the bough of a tree, and to hold it before him as
he marched to the attack, that Macbeth might not be able to discover the number
and the strength of the assailants. Thus Birnam wood came against Dunsinane.
When Macbeth saw the sight his courage failed him, and he saw that his
hour had come. A battle ensued, in which he was conquered and killed.</p>


<p class="smlpadt">Such is the story, and it seems a pity to spoil so good a story; but I fear
that Shakspeare made his wonderful plot of much the same &ldquo;stuff that dreams
are made of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duncan was a grandson of Malcolm II. on his father&rsquo;s side, and Macbeth
was a grandson of the same king, though on the side of his mother. On the
death of Malcolm, in 1033, each claimed the throne. Macbeth, according to rule
of Scottish succession, had the best claim, but Duncan obtained the power.
Macbeth was naturally dissatisfied, and the insolence of Malcolm, the son of
Duncan, who placed himself at the head of an intriguing party in Northumberland,
changed his dissatisfaction to resentment, and he slew the king. He once
had a dream, which he deemed remarkable, in which three old women met him
and hailed him as thane of Cromarty, thane of Moray, and finally as king.
Upon this light basis genius has built one of the most powerful tales of superstition
in the language.</p>

<p>Duncan was slain near Elgin, and not in the castle of Inverness. Malcolm
avenged his father&rsquo;s death, slaying Macbeth at a place called Lumphanan, and
not at Dunsinane, as recorded in the play.</p>

<p>And then Sir Walter Scott finds that &ldquo;Banquo and his son Fleance&rdquo; never
had any real existence, which leaves no material out of which to construct a
ghost.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>A STORY-TELLING JOURNEY.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">The Club Reorganized.&mdash;The Rhine and the Lands of the Baltic.&mdash;Tommy
Toby&rsquo;s Story of the Six Boy Kings.</p>


<p><span class="dcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>T the first formal meeting of the Club Charlie Leland
was chosen President. He was the intellectual
leader among the boys, now that the old Class had
gone; he was a lad of good principles, bright, generous,
and popular. As may be judged from the
somewhat discursive dialogue on the piazza, he
had a subject well matured in his mind for the literary exercises of the
Club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all like stories,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the Rhine lands are regions of
stories, as are the countries of the Baltic Sea. The tales and traditions
of the Rhine would give us a large knowledge of German history,
and, in fact, of the great empire of Europe, over which Charlemagne
ruled, and which now is divided into the kingdoms of Northern
Europe. The stories of haunted castles, spectres, water nymphs, sylvan
deities, and fairies, if shapes of fancy, are full of instruction, and
I know of no subject so likely to prove intensely interesting as the
Rhine and the Baltic; and I would like to propose it to the Club for
consideration, although, owing to my position as President, I do not
make a formal motion that it be adopted.&rdquo;</p>

Master Lewis had entered the room quietly while the business of
the Club was being thus happily and unanimously carried forward.
The boys had asked him to be present at the meeting, and to give
them his opinions of their plans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that your choice of a subject for your literary
evenings is an excellent one, but I notice a tendency to place more
stress on the fine old fictions of Germany and the North than upon
actual history. These fictions for the most part grew out of the disturbed
consciences of bad men in ignorant and barbarous times. They
were shapes of the imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me prepare your minds a little for a proper estimate of these
alluring and entertaining stories.&rdquo;</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">MASTER LEWIS ON POPULAR SUPERSTITIONS.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The front of Northumberland House, England, used to be ornamented with
the bronze statue of a lion, called Percy. A humorist, wishing to produce a
sensation, placed himself in front of the building, one day, and, assuming an
attitude of astonishment, exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wags, it wags!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes were riveted on the statue, to which the bystanders readily
observed that the exclamation referred. Quite a number of persons collected,
each one gazing on the bronze figure, expecting to see the phenomenon. Their
imagination supplied the desired marvel, and presently a street full of people
fancied that they could see the lion Percy wag his tail!</p>

<p>An old distich runs something as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Who believe that there are witches, there the witches are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who believe there aren&rsquo;t no witches, aren&rsquo;t no witches there.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is much more good sense than poetry in these lines. The marvels
of superstition are witnessed chiefly by those who believe in them.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The sights held as supernatural are usually not more wonderful than those
that arise from a disordered imagination. The spectres of demonology are not
more fearful than those shapes of fancy produced by opium and dissipation; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"><!-- illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the visions of the necromancer are not more wonderful than those that arise
from a fever, or even from a troubled sleep.</p>

<p>Yet it is a fact, and a very singular one, that, however at random the fancies
of unhealthy intellects may appear on ordinary subjects, those fancies obtain a
greater or less credit when they touch upon supernatural things. Instances of
monomaniacs (persons insane on a single subject) who have imagined things
quite as marvellous as the most superstitious, but whose illusions have been
treated with the greatest ridicule, might be cited almost without limit.</p>

<p>I once knew of an elderly lady, who thought that she was a goose. Making
a nest in one corner of the room, she put in it a few kitchen utensils, which
she supposed to be eggs, and began to incubate. She found the process of incubation,
in her case, a very slow one; and her friends, fearing for her health,
called in a doctor. He endeavored to reason with her, but she only replied
to his philosophy by stretching out her neck, which she seemed to think was a
remarkably long one, and hissing. The old lady had a set of gilt-band china
cups and saucers, which, in her eyes, had been a sort of household gods. The
knowledge of the fact coming to the ears of the physician, he advised her friends
to break the precious treasures, one after another, before her eyes. The plan
worked admirably. She immediately left her nest, and ran to the rescue of the
china, and the excitement brought her back to her sense of the proprieties of
womanhood.</p>

<p>Another old lady, who also resided in a neighboring town, fancied she had
become a veritable teapot. She used to silence those who attempted to reason
with her by the luminous argument, &ldquo;See, here (crooking one arm at her side)
is the handle, and there (thrusting upward her other arm) is the spout!&rdquo; What
could be more convincing than that?</p>

<p>Another lady, whose faculties had begun to decline, thought her toes were
made of glass; and a comical figure she cut when she went abroad, picking up
and putting down her feet with the greatest caution, lest she should injure her
precious toes.</p>

<p>Now these cases provoke a smile; but, had these ancient damsels fancied
that they were bewitched, or that they were haunted, or that they held communion
with the spirits of the invisible world, instead of exciting laughter and pity,
they would have occasioned no small excitement among the simple-minded
people of the neighborhood in which each resided.</p>

<p>A young Scottish farmer, having been to a fair, was riding homeward on
horseback one evening over a lonely road.</p>

<p>He had been drinking rather freely at the fair, according to the custom, and
his head was far from steady, and his conscience far from easy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
It was moonlight, and he began to reflect what a dreadful thing it would be
to meet a ghost. His fears caused him to look very carefully about him. As
he was approaching the old church in Teviotdale, he saw a figure in white standing
on the wall of the churchyard, by the highway.</p>

<p>The sight gave him a start, but he continued his journey, hoping that it was
his imagination that had invested some natural object with a ghostly shape.
But the nearer he approached, the more ghostlike and mysterious did the figure
appear.</p>

<p>He stopped, hesitating what to do, and then concluded to ride slowly. There
was no other way to his home than the one he was following. He knew well
enough that his mind was somewhat unsettled by drinking, and what he saw
might, after all, he thought, be nothing but an illusion. He would approach the
object slowly and cautiously, and, when very near it, would put spurs to his horse
and dash by.</p>

<p>As he drew near, however, the figure showed unmistakable signs of life,
gesticulating mysteriously, and uttering gibberish, that, although odd, sounded
surprisingly human.</p>

<p>It was a ghostly night: the dim moonlight filled the silent air, and the landscape
was flecked with shadows; it was a ghostly place,&mdash;Teviotdale churchyard;
and, in perfect keeping with the time and place, stood the figure, doing as
a ghost is supposed to do,&mdash;talking gibberish to the moon.</p>

<p>The young man&rsquo;s nerves were quite unstrung as he put spurs to his horse
for a rush by the object of his fright. As he dashed past, his hair almost bristling
with apprehension, the supposed phantom leaped upon the back of the
horse and clasped the frightened man about his waist. His apprehensions were
startling enough before, but now he was wrought to the highest pitch of terror.</p>

<p>He drove his spurs into his horse, and the animal flew over the earth like a
phantom steed. Such riding never before was seen in the winding road of
Teviotdale.</p>

<p>In a wonderfully short time the reeking animal stood trembling and panting
before his master&rsquo;s gate. The young man called lustily for his servants, who,
coming out, were commanded in frantic tones to &ldquo;Tak aff the ghaist, tak aff the
ghaist!&rdquo; And &ldquo;tak aff the ghaist&rdquo; they did, which proved to be a young lady
well known in Teviotdale for her unfortunate history.</p>

<p>She had married an estimable young man, to whom she was very strongly
attached, and the brightest worldly prospects seemed opening before her. Her
husband was taken ill, and suddenly died. She had confided in him so fondly
that the world lost its attractions for her on his decease, and she moodily dwelt
upon her misfortune until she became deranged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Her husband was buried in Teviotdale churchyard, and she was in the habit
of stealing away from her friends at night, to weep over his grave. These melancholy
visits had the effect of giving a new impetus to her malady, making her
for a time the victim of any fancy that chanced to enter her mind.</p>

<p>On the night of our story she imagined that the young farmer was her husband,
and awaited his approach with great exhilaration of spirits, determined to
give him an affectionate greeting.</p>

<p>The fright came near costing the young man his life. He was taken from
his saddle to his bed, where he lay for weeks prostrated by a high nervous
fever.</p>

<p>An eminent writer, after relating the above authentic story, remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this woman had dropped from the horse unobserved by the rider, it
would have been very hard to convince the honest farmer that he had not actually
performed a part of his journey with a ghost behind him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>True. Teviotdale churchyard would have obtained the reputation of being
haunted, and would have been a terror to weak-minded people for many years
to come.</p>

<p>The ignorant and simple are not alone subject to illusions of fancy. The
great and learned Pascal, than whom France has produced no more worthy
philosopher, believed that an awful chasm yawned by his side, into which he was
in danger of being thrown. This dreadful vision, with other fancies as gloomy,
cast a shadow over an eventful period of his life, and gave a dark coloring to
certain of his writings. Yet Pascal, on most subjects, was uncommonly sound
in judgment. How unfavorable might have been the influence, had his disorder
assumed a different form, and placed before him the delusion of a ghost!</p>

<p>Before giving credit to stories of supernatural events, even from sources that
seem to be trustworthy, I hope my young friends will consider duly how liable
to error are an unhealthy mind and an excited imagination. Every man is not a
knave or a cheat who claims to have witnessed unnatural phenomena, but the
judgment of very excellent persons is liable to be infected by illusions of the
imagination.</p>

<p>I do not say that we may not receive impressions from the spiritual world.
As the geologist, the botanist, the chemist, sees things in nature that the unschooled
and undeveloped do not see, so it may be that a spiritually educated
mind may know more of the spiritual world than the gross and selfish mind. I
will not enlarge upon this topic or discuss this question; it might not be
proper for me so to do.</p>
</div>

<p class="hrpadt"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Master Lewis had aimed to make clear to the boys that it is easy
to start a superstitious story, and to suggest that such stories in ignorant
times became <em>legends</em>.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD FORTRESS ON THE RHINE.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I propose,&rdquo; said Willie Clifton, &ldquo;that the first seven meetings of
the Club be devoted to the Rhine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might call this series of meetings <i>Seven Nights on the Rhine</i>,&rdquo;
added Herman Reed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old members of the Club who made the Rhine journey with
Mr. Beal might give us an account of that journey,&rdquo; suggested one of
the new boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
The plans suggested by these remarks met with approval, and a
committee was appointed to arrange the literary exercises for seven
meetings of the Club, to be known as <i>Seven Nights on the Rhine</i>.</p>

<p>The literary exercises for the present evening consisted of the relation
of historic ghost stories, chiefly by members of the old Club.
Among these were the Province House Stories of Hawthorne, the
tradition of Mozart&rsquo;s Requiem, the Cock Lane Ghost, and several
incidents from Scott&rsquo;s novels.</p>

<p>The principal story, however, was given by Tommy Toby, an old
member of the Club, and a graduate of the Academy.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">TOMMY TOBY&rsquo;S STORY OF ST. DUNSTAN AND THE DEVIL
AND THE SIX BOY KINGS.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>A splendid court had Athelstane, and foreign princes came there to be
educated. Among these princes was Louis, the son of Charles the Simple,
of France, who, by his long residence in England, obtained the pretty name of
<i>Louis d&rsquo;Outremer</i>.</p>

<p>Splendid weddings were celebrated there. The king married one of his
sisters to the King of France, another to the Emperor of Germany, another to
Hugo the Great, Count of Paris, and another to the Duke of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>After the fight with the Cornish men, all of the land was at peace for many
years, and the nobility became very scholarly and the people very polite.</p>

<p>Athelstane had a favorite, a friar, who made more mischief in his day and
generation than any other man. This man is known in history by the name of
St. Dunstan.</p>

<p>When Dunstan was a boy, he was taken very ill of a fever. One night, being
delirious, he got up from his bed, and walked to Glastonbury church, which was
then repairing, and ascended the scaffolds and went all over the building; and
because he did not tumble off and break his neck, people said that he had performed
the feat under the influence of inspiration, being directed by an angel.</p>

<p>This was called Dunstan&rsquo;s first miracle.</p>

<p>When he recovered from the fever, and heard of the miracle that he was said
to have wrought, he was greatly pleased, and thought to turn the good opinion
of people to his own advantage by performing other miracles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
So he made a harp that played in the wind,&mdash;now soft, now loud; now
sweet, now solemn. He said that the harp played itself. The people heard the
sounds, full of seeming expression, as though touched by airy fingers, and, as
they could not discredit the evidence of their own ears, they too reported that
the harp played itself. And great was the fame of Dunstan&rsquo;s harp.</p>

<p>But Dunstan, according to old history, became a very bad man; so bad that
I cannot tell you the worst things that he did. He discovered his true character
at last, notwithstanding his sweetly playing harp.</p>

<p>He pretended to be a magician. Now a magician, in those old times, was
one who was supposed to know things beyond the reach of common minds, who
pretended to calculate the influence of the stars on a person&rsquo;s destiny, and who
understood the effects of poisonous vegetables and minerals. The Saxon
magicians were chiefly nobles and monks, and all of their great secrets which
are worth knowing are now understood as simple matters of science, even by
schoolboys.</p>

<p>Athelstane&rsquo;s conscience must have been rather restless, I fancy, concerning
young Edwin, his brother, whom he caused to be drowned; and people with
unquiet conscience are usually very superstitious. At any rate, he made a
bosom friend of Dunstan, after the latter took up the black art, and became
greatly interested in magic, much to the sorrow of the people.</p>

<p>At last a party of the king&rsquo;s friends resolved that the bad influence of the
wily prelate should come to an end. They waylaid him one dark night, in an
unfrequented place, and, binding him hand and foot, threw him into a miry
marsh. But the water was shallow, and Dunstan kept his nose above the mire,
and, after shouting lustily for help, and floundering about for a long time, he
succeeded in getting out, to make a great deal of noise and trouble in the world,
and we have some strange stories to tell you about him yet.</p>

<p>Athelstane died in the year 940, and he was succeeded upon the throne by
his half-brother, Edmund, who was the first of the six boy kings.</p>

<p>Edmund was eighteen years of age when he took his place on the honorable
Saxon throne of Alfred the Great. He was a high-spirited young man, warm-hearted
and brave. He conquered Cumberland from the Ancient Britons, and
protected his kingdom against the fierce sea-kings of the North. Like his great
ancestor, King Alfred, he was fond of learning and art. He improved and
adorned public places and buildings. He made a very elegant appearance, and
held a showy court, and they called him the Magnificent.</p>

<p>But Edmund was fond of convivial suppers, and used himself to drink deeply
of wine. He lived fast, and his friends lived fast, though they appeared to live
very happily and merrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
But young men given to festive suppers and to wine are not apt to make a
long history; and the history of Edmund the Magnificent, the first boy king,
was a short one.</p>

<p>Edmund was succeeded in the year 946 by Edred, his brother, a well-meaning
youth, who was the second of the six boy kings of England.</p>

<p>Dunstan had become abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, the church where he
performed the miracle when he was sick of the fever. He was very ambitious
to meddle in affairs of state, but his bad name had weakened his influence with
Edmund, and it seemed likely to do the same with well-intentioned Edred. He
desired to
create a public
impression
again
that he was
a saint.</p>

<p>He retired
to a
cell and
there spent
his time
working
very hard
as a smith,
and&mdash;so the
report went&mdash;in
devotion.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">ST. DUNSTAN AND THE DEVIL.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Then the
people said:
&ldquo;How humble
and penitent Dunstan is! He has the back-ache all day, and the leg-ache
all night, and he suffers all for the cause of purity and truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Dunstan told the people that the Devil came to tempt him, which, with
his aches for the good cause, made his situation very trying.</p>

<p>The Devil, he said, wanted him to lead a life of selfish gratification, but he
would not be tempted to do a thing like that; he never thought of himself,&mdash;oh,
no, good soul, not he.</p>

<p>The people said that Dunstan must have become a very holy man, or the
Devil would not appear to him bodily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
One day a great noise was heard issuing from the retreat of this man, and
filling all the air for miles, the like of which was never known before. The
people were much astonished. Some of them went to Dunstan to inquire the
cause. He told them a story of a miracle more marvellous than any that he had
previously done.</p>

<p>The Devil came to him, he said, as he was at work at his forge, and tempted
him to lead a life of pleasure. He quickly drew his pincers from the fire, and
seized his tormentor by the nose, which put him in such pain that he bellowed
so lustily as to shake the hills. The people said that it was the bellowing of
the Evil One that they had heard.</p>

<p>This wonderful story ended to Dunstan&rsquo;s liking, for the artful do flourish
briefly sometimes.</p>

<p>The boy king Edred was in ill-health, and suffered from a lingering illness
for years. He felt the need of the counsel of a good man. He said to himself,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is Dunstan, a man who has given up all selfish feelings and aspirations,
a man whom even the Devil cannot corrupt. I will bring him to court,
and will make him my adviser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then pure-hearted Edred brought the foxy prelate to his court, and made
him&mdash;of all things in the world!&mdash;the royal treasurer.</p>

<p>Edred died in the year 955, having for nine years aimed to do justly and to
govern well. His decease, like his brother&rsquo;s before him, was sincerely lamented.</p>

<p>He left a well-ordered government, except in the department of the treasury.
Some remarkable &ldquo;irregularities&rdquo;&mdash;as stealing is sometimes called nowadays&mdash;had
taken place there, some of the public money having become mixed up with
Dunstan&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The next of the six boy kings of England was Edwy the Fair,&mdash;fifteen years
of age when he ascended the throne.</p>

<p>He was the son of Edmund,&mdash;a handsome boy, and as good at heart as he
was handsome. Though so young, he had married a beautiful princess, named
Elgiva. So we have here a boy king and a girl queen.</p>

<p>As if one bad prelate were not enough, there was, besides Dunstan, another
great mischief-maker, Odo, the Dane, Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>The coronation of Edwy was the occasion of great rejoicing. They had a
sumptuous feast in the evening, attended by all the prelates and thanes. Edwy
liked the society of the girl queen better than that of these rude people, and in
the midst of the festivities he retired to the queen&rsquo;s apartment to see her and
the queen mother.</p>

<p>Odo, the archbishop, noticed that the boy king had left his place at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
tables. He rightly guessed the reason, and deemed such conduct disrespectful
to himself and to the guests. So he went and made complaint to Dunstan, and
Dunstan went to look for the missing king. When the latter came to the
queen&rsquo;s apartment, and was refused admittance, he broke open the door, upbraided
Edwy for his absence from the feast, and, seizing him by the collar,
dragged and pushed him roughly back to the banqueting-hall.</p>

<p>Edwy, of course, resented this treatment. Dunstan replied by accusing him
of great impropriety, and talked in a very overbearing way, and Edwy, though a
considerate boy, and of a mild disposition, at last lost his temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a very nice sense of propriety,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You were the treasurer
in the last reign, I believe. I intend to call you to account for the way that
you fulfilled your trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dunstan was greatly astonished, and, guilty man that he was, he began to
feel very unsafe.</p>

<p>The boy king made the attempt which he had threatened, to call Dunstan
to account for his late doings in the treasury. But the latter, when he found
that Edwy was in earnest, fled to Ghent.</p>

<p>The nobles saw somewhat into his true character when he thus disappeared
from court, and a party of men was sent in pursuit of him to put out his eyes.
But he was too foxy to be caught, and arrived safely in Belgium at last, to make
a great deal of trouble in the world yet.</p>

<p>Incited by Dunstan, Odo raised a rebellion. When he had drawn to himself
a sufficient party to insure his personal safety, he proclaimed Edgar, the younger
brother of Edwy, king.</p>

<p>Dunstan returned to England, and joined Odo, and this precious pair soon
discovered the value of their piety, as you shall presently see.</p>

<p>Edwy the Fair loved the girl queen. She was beautiful as well as amiable,
and was as devoted to her husband as she was lovely. Odo and Dunstan
wished to break the spirit of Edwy, and thought to accomplish their end by
capturing the queen. They caused her to be stolen from one of the royal
palaces, and her cheeks to be burned with hot irons, in order to destroy the
beauty that had so enchanted the boy king. They then sent her to Ireland,
and sold her as a slave.</p>

<p>The Irish people pitied the weeping maiden, and loved her. They healed
the scars on her cheeks, that the hot irons had made. When her beauty
returned, she grew light-hearted again, and all her dreams were of the king.</p>

<p>Then the Irish people released her from bondage, and gave her money to
return to Edwy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
She entered England full of joyful anticipations, and made rapid journeys
towards the place where Edwy held his court. But Odo and Dunstan, who had
been apprised of her coming, intercepted her, and ordered that she should be
tortured and put to death. They caused the cords of her limbs to be severed,
so that she was unable to walk or move. The beautiful girl survived the cutting
and maiming but a few days.</p>

<p>Weeping continually over her disappointments and sorrows, and shrieking
at times from the acuteness of her pain, she died at Gloucester,&mdash;perhaps the
most unfortunate princess who ever came to the English throne.</p>

<p>When Edwy heard of her death, he ceased to struggle for his right; he
cared for nothing more. He grew paler and thinner day by day, his beauty
faded, his thoughts turned heavenward, and he aspired to a better crown and
kingdom. He died of a broken heart before he reached the age of twenty,
having aimed for three years to govern well.</p>

<p>Edwy&rsquo;s short reign was followed by that of his brother Edgar, who succeeded
to the Anglo-Saxon throne in the year 959, and was an unprincipled and
dissolute king.</p>

<p>He was fifteen years of age when he began to reign. One of his first acts
was to reward the intriguing Dunstan for his crimes by bestowing upon him the
archbishopric of Canterbury. Think of conferring an archbishopric as the price
of a brother&rsquo;s ruin and death! Ah, better to be Edwy the Fair in his early
grave, with the birds singing and the violets waving above him, than the cruel
boy Edgar upon the throne.</p>

<p>He resigned the government almost wholly to Dunstan, his primate, and
spent his time in gayety, pleasure, and ease. He was unstable, profligate, and
vicious. He once broke into a convent and carried off a beautiful nun, named
Editha. For this violation of the sanctuary, Dunstan commanded him not to
wear his crown for seven years, which was no great punishment, as he could
ornament his head as well in some other way.</p>

<p>Dunstan certainly possessed great ability as a statesman. He employed the
vast armaments of England against the neighboring sovereigns, and compelled
the King of Scotland and the Princes of Wales, of the Isle of Man, and of the
Orkneys, to do homage to Edgar.</p>

<p>The boy king annually made a voyage around England in great state,
accompanied by princes and nobles.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, when he wished to visit the Abbey of St. John
the Baptist, on the River Dee, he appointed eight crowned kings to pull the oars
of his barge, while he himself acted as steersman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
The vainglorious young sovereign then went into the grand old abbey and
said his prayers, after which he returned in the same pomp, rowed by the eight
subject kings.</p>

<p>This event is celebrated in the songs and ballads of the olden time, which
tell of the glory of England, when the eight crowns glimmered on the sun-covered
waters of the Dee.</p>

<p>Edgar, who was King of England up to the year 975, married twice, and left
two sons. The elder of these was named Edward, the son of a good queen,
Ethelfreda; the other was named Ethelred, the son of the bad queen, Elfrida.</p>

<p>Edward had the best claim to the throne, but the intriguing Elfrida endeavored
to secure the succession to her own son, Ethelred, a boy about seven years
old. Dunstan decided against her, and caused Edward to be crowned. The
boy king was at this time thirteen years of age.</p>

<p>He was an amiable, susceptible boy, loving every one, and wishing every
one well, and believing, with childish simplicity, that all the world was as pure
at heart and as unselfish as himself.</p>

<p>But Elfrida hated him, and resolved that his reign should be a short one, if
it was within the reach of her arts to make it so.</p>

<p>She retired with little Ethelred to Crofe Castle, a beautiful country seat in
Dorsetshire. Green forests waved around it, and blue hills seemed to semicircle
the sky. The silver horn of the hunter often echoed through the stream-cleft
woodlands, and merrily blew before the castle gate.</p>

<p>Edward and a youthful court party went hunting one day in the dreamy
old forests of Dorsetshire. Chancing to ride near Crofe Castle, Edward thought
that he would like to see Elfrida and his little brother. So he separated himself
from his attendants, rode to the castle, and blew his horn.</p>

<p>Elfrida presently appeared, her face glowing with smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art welcome, dear king,&rdquo; she said, in a winning way. &ldquo;Pray dismount
and come in, and we will have pleasant talk and good cheer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; said Edward. &ldquo;My company would notice my absence, and
think that some evil had befallen me. Please bring me a cup of wine, and I will
drink to your health and to my little brother&rsquo;s, in my saddle, and then I must
away with speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elfrida turned away to order the wine. She gave another order at the same
time in a whisper to an armed attendant.</p>

<p>The wine was brought. Elfrida filled the cup and handed it to the boy
king. As he held it up it sparkled in the light. Elfrida stood in the gateway,
holding little Ethelred by the hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
&ldquo;Health,&rdquo; said Edward, putting the bright cup to his lips.</p>

<p>There crept up behind him softly an armed man, whose muscles stood out
like brass, and whose eyes burned like fire. He sprang upon the boy king and
stabbed him in the back. The affrighted horse dashed away, dragging the
bleeding body by the stirrup,&mdash;on, on, on, over rut and rock, bush and brier.</p>

<p>They tracked him by his blood. They found his broken body at last. They
took it up tenderly and with many tears, and laid it beneath the moss and fern.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE MURDER OF EDWARD.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>When little Ethelred saw his brother stabbed and bleeding, and dragged
over the rough earth, he began to weep. Elfrida beat him and sent him to his
chamber.</p>

<p>What a night was that when the moon silvered the forest! One boy king
mangled and dead on the cold ground, and another boy king weeping in the
forest castle, and beaten and bruised for being touched at heart at the murder
of his bright, innocent brother.</p>

<p>Ethelred came to the English throne at the age of ten. He was the last of
the six boy kings.</p>

<p>The people held him in disfavor from the first on account of his bad mother,
and when Dunstan put the crown on his head at Kingston, he pronounced a
curse instead of a blessing. Neither the blessing nor the curse of a man like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Dunstan could be of much account, and we do not believe that the latter did the
little boy Ethelred any harm.</p>

<p>Dunstan was now old and as full of craft and wickedness as he was full of
years. He continued to practise jugglery, which he called performing miracles,
whenever he found his influence declining, or had an important end to accomplish.</p>

<p>In the reign of Ethelred Dunstan died. As he had used politics to help the
church, he was made a saint. This was in a rude and ignorant age.</p>

<p>Poor boy kings! Edmund was murdered; Edwy died of a broken heart;
Edward was stabbed and dragged to death at his horse&rsquo;s heels; and Ethelred
lost his kingdom. Three of them were good and three were bad. Only one of
them was happy.</p>

<p>Edmund, eighteen years of age, reigned from 940 to 946; Edred, 946 to
955; Edwy, fifteen years of age, 955 to 958; Edgar, fifteen years of age, 958
to 975; Edward, thirteen years of age, 975 to 979; Ethelred, ten years of age,
979 to 1016.</p>

<p>So the boy kings reigned in all seventy-six years, and governed England in
their youth for nearly fifty years.</p>
</div>

<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;I like your story, Master Toby,&rdquo; said Master Lewis; &ldquo;as a story,
I mean. The historic facts are mainly as you have given them, but
I think St. Dunstan&rsquo;s intentions may have been good, after all. He
lived in an age of superstition, when it was believed that any political
act was right that would increase the power of the church. Christianity
then was not what it had been in the early church nor what it
is to-day. Men must be somewhat regarded in the light of the times
in which they lived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The literary exercises for the evening were thus closed.</p>

<h3>GERMAN STORIES.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">The Story of the Emperor William.&mdash;The Story of &ldquo;Sneeze with Delight.&rdquo;&mdash;Poem-Stories.</p>


<p><span class="dcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>T the first meeting of the Club to study the history
and to relate stories of the Rhine and the North,
Master Lewis was present, and, after the preliminary
business had been transacted, said that he
had some suggestions in mind which he wished to
make.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I notice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that many of you have been obtaining from
the Boston Public Library English translations of the works of Hauff,
Hoffman, Baron de La Motte Fouqu&eacute;, Grimm, Schiller, and Tieck, and
I think that there is danger that story-reading and story-telling may
occupy too much of your time and thought. Let me propose that a
brief history of each author be given with the story at the meetings
of the Club, so that you may at least obtain some knowledge of German
literature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suggestion met with the approval of all, and it was voted that
at future meetings the biographies of authors should be given with
the stories, and that only the stories of the best authors should be
selected, except in the case of legends of places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have another proposal to make,&rdquo; said Master Lewis. &ldquo;You are
not very familiar with German politics. Suppose you let me give you
from time to time some short talks about the German Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and its ministers,&mdash;King William, Count Bismarck, and Count Von
Moltke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This kind offer was received with cheers and placed upon record
with thanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you may be willing to open our exercises to-night with
one of the talks you have planned,&rdquo; said the President. &ldquo;It would be
a helpful beginning, which we would appreciate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not as well prepared as I would like,&rdquo; said the teacher; &ldquo;but
as I believe in making a first meeting of this kind a sort of a model
in its plan and purpose, I will in a free way tell you something of</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE STORY OF THE EMPEROR WILLIAM.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The life of the Emperor of Germany has been full of thrilling and dramatic
scenes.</p>

<p>When he was a boy, Germany&mdash;the great Germany of Charlemagne&mdash;was
divided into states, each having its own ruler. His father was Frederick William
III., King of Prussia, and his mother was Louise, an excellent woman; his
youth was passed amid the excitements of Napoleon&rsquo;s conquests. Russia and
Prussia combined against Napoleon; Russia was placed at a disadvantage in
two doubtful battles, when she deserted the Prussian cause, and made a treaty
of peace.</p>

<p>Napoleon then sent for the King of Prussia, to tell him what he would
leave him.</p>

<p>The lovely Queen Louise went with the unfortunate king to meet the
French conqueror, hoping thereby to obtain more favorable terms. But Napoleon
treated her with scorn, boasting that he was like &ldquo;waxed cloth to rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He, however, offered the queen a rose, in a softer moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Louise, thinking of her kingdom, &ldquo;but with Magdeburg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is <em>I</em> who give, and <em>you</em> who take,&rdquo; answered Napoleon haughtily.</p>

<p>Napoleon took away from Prussia all the lands on the Elbe and the Rhine,
and, uniting these to other German states, formed a kingdom for his brother
Jerome.</p>

<p>The good Queen Louise pined away with grief and shame at her country&rsquo;s
losses, and died two years after of a broken heart. So the boyhood of William
was very sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
It is said that children fulfil the ideals of their mothers. Poor Louise little
thought that her second son would one day be crowned Emperor of all Germany
in the palace of the French kings at Versailles.</p>

<p>William was born in 1797; he ascended the throne as King of Prussia in
1861. How widely these dates stand apart!</p>

<p>On the day of his coronation as King of Prussia, he exhibited his own character
and religious faith by putting the crown on his own head. &ldquo;I rule,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;by the favor of God and no one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under his vigorous rule Prussia grew in military power, and excited the
jealousy of the French people. Napoleon III., on a slight pretext, declared war
with Prussia. In this war Prussia was victorious.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="smlpadt">A MEMORABLE HOUR.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>That was indeed a memorable hour in the emperor&rsquo;s life when he met the
fallen Emperor of the French in the Chateau Bellevue, on a hill of the Meuse
overlooking Sedan. The king and the emperor had met before; they then were
equals, brother rulers of two of the most powerful nations on earth. They met
now as conqueror and captive, and the one held the fate of the other in his
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were both moved at seeing each other again under such circumstances,&rdquo;
said King William. &ldquo;I had seen Napoleon only three years before, at the
summit of his power. What my feelings were is more than I can describe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king spoke first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God has given victory to me in the war that has been declared against
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The war,&rdquo; said Napoleon, &ldquo;was not sought by me. I did not desire it.
I declared it in obedience to the public sentiment of France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;made the war to meet public opinion; but
your ministers created that public opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your artillery, sire, won the battle. The Prussian artillery is the finest in
the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has your Majesty any conditions to propose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None: I have no power; I am a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the government in France with which I can treat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Paris: the empress and the ministers. I am powerless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King William, as you know, marched to Paris, and at last made conditions
of peace almost as hard as Napoleon I. had made with his father. The German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
princes in his hour of victory offered him the crown of Southern Germany, and
he was crowned at Versailles, in the great hall of mirrors, Emperor of Germany.</p>

<p>Let me now speak of the kaiser&rsquo;s</p>
</div>


<h4 class="smlpadt">MILITARY CAREER.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>It is rare that men and women live to celebrate their seventy-fifth birthday.
The age allotted to mortals by the Psalmist is threescore and ten.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE EMPEROR WILLIAM AND NAPOLEON III.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>But the hale old Emperor of Germany has not only recently commemorated
the completion of his eighty-sixth year, but&mdash;what is still more striking&mdash;at the
same time marked the seventy-sixth year of his service as an officer in the Prussian
army.</p>

<p>It is related that, on the 22d of March, 1807, on which day William was just
ten years old, his father, then King of Prussia, called him into his study and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
&ldquo;My son, I appoint you an officer in my army. You will serve in Company
No. 1 of the First Guard Regiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little prince drew himself up, gave his father a prompt military salute,
and retired. An hour later he reappeared before the king, attired in the uniform
of his new rank; and, repeating the salute, announced to his
royal father that &ldquo;he
was ready for duty.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<img src="images/zjnl021.jpg" width="500" height="356" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">WILLIAM BEFORE HIS FATHER.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Even at so early
an age, William was
no fancy soldier,
holding rank and
title, and leaving to
humbler officers the duties and hardships. He
at once devoted himself to the task of a junior
ensign; and from that time onward became an officer in truth, laboring zealously
to master the military science, and rising step by step, not by favor, but
by merit and seniority.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen, William was in Blucher&rsquo;s army at Waterloo, taking
an active part in the overthrow of Napoleon, and witnessing that mighty downfall.
A little later, he was promoted to the rank of major for cool courage under
heavy fire; and from that time on, for nearly half a century, William devoted
himself wholly to the military profession.</p>

<p>When he ascended the Prussian throne, there was no more unpopular man
in the kingdom. He had put down the revolutionary rising in Berlin with grim
and relentless hand; and the people believed that their new monarch was a
cruel and haughty tyrant.</p>

<p>It was not until after the great triumph over Austria, in 1866, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Prussians began to discover that King William was not only a valiant soldier, but an
ardent lover of his country, and a kind-hearted, whole-souled father of his
people.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE STATESMAN.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>For the last sixteen years, no sovereign in Europe has been more devotedly
beloved and revered by his subjects. Although William is autocratic, and believes
in his &ldquo;divine right&rdquo; to rule as sturdily as did his medi&aelig;val ancestors,
and has not a little contempt for popular clamors and popular rights, his reign
has been on the whole brilliantly wise and successful. While this has been in a
great measure due to the presence of a group of great men around him,&mdash;notably
of Bismarck and Von Moltke,&mdash;the emperor himself has had no small share
in promoting the power and towering fortunes of Germany.</p>

<p>His paternal ways with his people, his military knowledge, his fine, frank,
hearty, chivalrous nature, his sound sense in the choice of his advisers, and his
perception of the wisdom
of their counsels,
have much aided
in raising Prussia
and Germany to their
present height in
Europe.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">KING WILLIAM&rsquo;S HELMET.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Beneath his commanding
and rugged
exterior there beats
a very kindly heart.
Many incidents have
been related to show
the simple good-nature of his character. In his study, on the table at which he
writes, there has long remained a rusty old cavalry helmet, the relic of some
military association of the emperor.</p>

<p>Whenever the death-warrant of a condemned criminal is brought to him to
sign, the emperor looks at it, and then slyly slips the fatal document under the
helmet. Sometimes his ministers, anxious that the warrants should be signed,
take occasion, in his absence from the study, to pull the papers out from beneath
the helmet, just enough to catch their master&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>Most often, however William, on perceiving them, quietly pushes them back
again, without a word. So great is his repugnance to dooming even a hardened
criminal to death, by a mere scratch of his pen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
At eighty-six, the stalwart old kaiser cannot hope to dwell much longer
among his people; but it will be very long before his fine qualities, soldierly
courage, and affectionate nature will grow dim in the memory of the fatherland.</p>

<p class="hrpadt">The stories related at this meeting were largely from Grimm and
Fouqu&eacute;, and are to be found in American books.</p>

<p>The most pleasing of the stories, told by Herman Reed, is not so
well known, and we give it here.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">SNEEZE WITH DELIGHT.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Many, many years ago there lived in an old German town a good cobbler
and his wife. They had one child, Jamie, a handsome boy of some eight years.
They were poor people; and the good wife, to help her husband, had a stall in
the great market, where she sold fruit and herbs.</p>

<p>One day the cobbler&rsquo;s wife was at the market as usual, and her little boy was
with her, when a strange old woman entered the stalls.</p>

<p>The woman hardly seemed human. She had red eyes, a wizened, pinched-up
face, and her nose was sharp and hooked, and almost reached to her chin. Her
dress was made up of rags and tatters. Never before had there entered the market
such a repulsive-looking person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Hannah the herb-woman?&rdquo; she asked, bobbing her head to and
fro. &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see, let me see; you may have some herbs I want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thrust her skinny hands into the herbs, took them up and smelled of
them, crushing them as she did so.</p>

<p>Having mauled them to her heart&rsquo;s content, she shook her head, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad stuff; rubbish; nothing I want; rubbish, rubbish,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an impudent old hag,&rdquo; said the cobbler&rsquo;s boy, Jamie; &ldquo;you have
crushed our herbs, held them under your ugly nose, and now condemn them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha, my son, you do not like my nose,&mdash;eh? You shall have one, too, to
pay for this,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you want to buy anything, pray do so at once,&rdquo; said the cobbler&rsquo;s wife;
&ldquo;you are keeping other customers away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>will</em> buy something,&rdquo; said the hag viciously; &ldquo;I <em>will</em> buy. I will take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
these six cabbages. Six? That is more than I can carry, as I have to lean
upon my stick. You must let your boy take them home for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was but a reasonable request, and the cobbler&rsquo;s wife consented.</p>

<p>Jamie did as he was bid, and followed the hag to her home. It was a long
distance there. At last the beldam stopped in an out-of-the-way part of the
town, before a strange-looking house. She touched a rusty key to the door,
which flew open, and, as
the two entered, a most
astonishing sight was revealed
to Jamie&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>The interior of the
house was like a throne-room
in a palace, the ceilings
were of marble and
gold, and the furniture
was jewelled ebony.</p>

<p>The old woman took a
silver whistle and blew it.
Little animals&mdash;guinea
pigs and squirrels&mdash;answered
the call. They
were dressed like children,
and walked on two legs;
they could talk and understand
what was said to
them. Was the beldam
an enchantress, and were
these little animals children,
whom she had stolen
and made victims of her
enchantments?</p>

</div>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, child,&rdquo; said the old woman, in a soft voice, &ldquo;sit down; you have
had a heavy load to carry. Sit down, and I will make you a delicious soup; one
that you will remember as long as you live. It will contain some of the herb for
which I was looking in the market and did not find. Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beldam hurried hither and thither, and with the help of the guinea
pigs and squirrels quickly made the soup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, my child, eat that. It contains the magic herb I could not find in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the market. Why did your mother not have it? Whoever eats that will become
a magic cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jamie had never tasted such delicious soup. It seemed to intoxicate him.
It produced a stupor. He felt a great change coming over him. He seemed to
become one of the family of guinea pigs and squirrels, and, like them, to serve
their mistress. Delightful little people they were,&mdash;he came to regard them as
brothers; and time flew by.</p>

<p>Years flew by, and other years, when one day the dame took her crutch and
went out. She left her herb-room open, and he went in. In one of the secret
cupboards he discovered an herb that had the same scent as the soup he had
eaten years before. He examined it. The leaves were blue and the blossoms
crimson. He smelt of it.</p>

<p>He began to sneeze,&mdash;such a delightful sneeze! He smelt, and sneezed
again. Suddenly he seemed to awake, as from a dream,&mdash;as though some
strange enchantment had been broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How mother will laugh when I tell her my
dream! I ought not to have gone to sleep in a strange house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out into the street. The children and idlers began to follow him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho, oho! look, what a strange dwarf! Look at his nose! Never the
like was seen before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jamie tried to discover the dwarf, but could not see him.</p>

<p>He reached the market. His mother was there, a sad old woman, in the
same place. She seemed altered; looked many years older than when he left
her. She leaned her head wearily on her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, mother dear?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She started up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want of me, you poor dwarf? Do not mock me. I have had
sorrow, and cannot endure jokes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, mother, what has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rushed towards her to embrace her, but she leaped into the air.</p>

<p>The market-women came to her and drove him away.</p>

<p>He went to his father&rsquo;s cobbler&rsquo;s shop. His father was there, but he looked
like an old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! what is that?&rdquo; said he wildly, as Jamie appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you getting on, master?&rdquo; asked Jamie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poorly enough. I&rsquo;m getting old, and have no one to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven only knows. He was kidnapped one market-day, seven years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven years ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jamie turned away. The people on the street stared at him, and the ill-bred
children followed him. He chanced to pass a barber&rsquo;s shop, where was a looking-glass
in the window. He stopped and saw himself.</p>

<p>The sight filled him with terror. He was a dwarf, <em>with a nose like that of
the strange old woman</em>.</p>

<p>What should he do?</p>

<p>He remembered that the old woman had said that the eating of the magic
soup that contained the magic herb
would make him a magic cook.</p>

<p>He went to the palace of the
duke and inquired for the major
domo. He was kindly received, as
dwarfs are in such places, and he
asked to be employed in the kitchen,
and allowed to show his skill in preparing
some of the rare dishes for the
table.</p>

<p>No one in the ducal palace was
able to produce such food as he.
He was made chief cook in a little
time, and enjoyed the duke&rsquo;s favor
for two years. He grew fat, was
honored at the great feasts, and became
the wonder of the town.</p>

<p>Now happened the strangest
thing of his strange life.</p>

open them now.)</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>One morning he went to the goose market to buy some nice fat geese, such
as he knew the duke would relish. He purchased a cage of three geese, but he
noticed that one of the geese did not quack and gabble like the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor thing must be sick,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will make haste to kill her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his great astonishment, the goose made answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Stop my breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will cause your early death.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Then he knew that the goose was some enchanted being, and he resolved to
spare her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not always had feathers on you, as now?&rdquo; said the dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I am Mimi, daughter of Waterbrook the Great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prithee be calm; I will be your friend; I know how to pity you. I was
once a squirrel myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the duke made a great feast, and invited the prince. The prince was
highly pleased with the ducal dishes, and praised the cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is one dish that you have not provided,&rdquo; said the prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked the duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>P&acirc;t&eacute; Suzerain.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duke ordered the dwarf to make the rare dish for the next banquet.</p>

<p>The dwarf obeyed.</p>

<p>When the prince had tasted, he pushed it aside, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing lacking,&mdash;one peculiar herb. It is not like that which
is provided for my own table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duke, in a towering passion, sent for the dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not prepare this dish rightly for the next banquet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
shall lose your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the dwarf was in great distress, and he went to consult with the goose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what is wanting,&rdquo; said the goose; &ldquo;it is an herb called Sneeze with
Delight. I will help you find it.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The dwarf took the goose under his arm, and asked of the guard, who had
been placed over him until he should prepare the dish,
permission to go into the garden.</p>

<p>They were allowed to go. They searched in vain
for a long time; but at last the goose spied the magic
leaf across the lake, and swam across, and returned
with it in her bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the magic herb the old woman used in the
soup,&rdquo; said the dwarf. &ldquo;Thank the Fates! we may
now be delivered from our enchantment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a long, deep sniff of the herb. He then
sneezed with delight, and lo! he began to grow, and his nose began to shrink,
and he was transformed to the handsomest young man in all the land.</p>

<p>He took the goose under his arm, and walked out of the palace yard. He
carried her to a great magician, who delivered her from her enchantment,
and she sneezed three sneezes, and became the handsomest lady in all the
kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Now, Mimi&rsquo;s father was very rich, and he loaded Jamie with presents, which
were worth a great fortune.</p>

<p>Then handsome Jamie married the lovely Mimi; and he brought his old
father and mother to live with them in a palace, and they were all exceedingly
happy.</p>
</div>

<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;What is the moral of such a tale as that?&rdquo; asked one of the
Club.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have any crookedness, to find the magic herb,&rdquo; said
Charlie.</p>

<p>Charlie Leland, the President, closed the exercises with some
translations of his own, which he called &ldquo;Stories in Verse.&rdquo; We give
two of them here; each relates an incident of Eberhard, the good
count, whom German poets have often remembered in song.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE SECOND MEETING OF THE CLUB.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">Constance.&mdash;The Story of Huss.&mdash;Bismarck and the German Government.&mdash;The
Story of the Heart of Stone.&mdash;Poem.&mdash;Seven Nights on the Rhine:
Night First.</p>


<p><span class="dcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE second meeting of the Club was opened by Mr.
Beal with an account of Constance, and of the great
Council that convened there in 1414.</p>


<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;<em>Via Mala!</em> So the old Romans called the
road near the source of the Rhine. It passed over
and through dark and awful chasms, that the river, as it came down
from the Alps, had been tunnelling for thousands of years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rhine is the gift of the Alps, as Egypt is the gift of the Nile.
From its source amid the peaks of the clouds to its first great reservoir,
the Lake of Constance, it passes through one of the wildest and
most picturesque regions in the world. It is not strange that the
Romans should have called their old Swiss road <i>Via Mala</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lake Constance! How our heads bent and our feelings kindled
and glowed when we beheld it! It is the most beautiful lake that
Germany possesses. It is walled by snow-capped mountains, whose
tops seem like islands in the blue lakes of the skies. Quaint towns
are nestled among the groves of the shore; towers, with bells ringing
soft and melodious in the still air. The water is like emerald. Afar,
zigzagging sails flap mechanically in the almost pulseless air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is color everywhere, of all hues: high, rich tones of color;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
low tones. Piles of gems on the mountains, gloomy shadows in the
groves; a deep
cerulean sky
above, that the
sunlight fills
like a golden
sea. At sunset
the lake seems
indeed like the
vision that John
saw,&mdash;&lsquo;a sea of
glass, mingled
with fire.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">BRIDGE IN THE VIA MALA.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The town
of Constance,
once a great city,
is as old as the
period of Constantine.
When
Charlemagne
went to Rome
to receive the
imperial crown,
he rested here.
Here a long line
of German
kings left the
associations of
great festivities;
here those kings
passed their
Christmases and Easters. Here convened brilliant regal assemblies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Here the ambassadors from Milan appeared before Barbarossa, and
delivered to him the golden key of the Italian states.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these events are of comparatively small importance in comparison
with the so-called Holy Council of Constance, in 1414. It was
a time of spiritual dearth in the world. Arrogance governed the Church,
and immorality flourished in it. There were three popes, each at
war with the others,&mdash;John XXIII., Benedict XII., and Gregory XII.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Council was called to choose a pope, and to reform the Church.
The town for four years became the centre of European history.
Hither came kings and princes; the court of the world was here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The town filled, and filled. It was like a great fair. Delegates
came from the North and the South, the East and the West. There
were splendid f&ecirc;tes; luxury and vainglory. At one time there were
present a hundred thousand men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Council accomplished nothing by way of reform, except to
induce the three rival popes to relinquish their claims to a fourth; but
it stained its outward glory with a crime that will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we were in Florence,&mdash;beautiful Florence!&mdash;the tragedy
of Savonarola rose before us like a spectre in the history of the past.
Savonarola tried to reform the conduct of the clergy and to maintain
the purity of the Church, but failed. He made the republic of Florence
a model Christian commonwealth. Debauchery was suppressed,
gambling was prohibited, the licentious factions of the times were there
publicly destroyed. He arraigned Rome for her sins. The Roman
party turned against him and accused him of heresy, the punishment
of which was death. He declared his innocence, and desired to test it
with his accusers by walking through a field of living fire. He believed
God would protect him from the flames, like the worthies of old. His
enemies were unwilling to go with him into the fiery ordeal. He was
condemned and executed. The martyr of Florence in after years
became one of its saints.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Constance a like tragedy haunted us. Constance has been
called &lsquo;the city of Huss.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
&ldquo;Among the mighty ones who wended their way to the city of the
lake, to attend the great Council, was a pale, thin man, in mean attire.
He had been invited
to the Council by the
Emperor Sigismund,
who promised to protect
his person and his
life. He was a Bohemian
reformer; a follower
of Wycliffe. He
was graciously received,
but was soon
after thrown into
prison on the charge
of heresy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They led him in
chains before the
Council, which assembled
in an old hall,
which is still shown.
The emperor sat upon
the throne as president.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He confessed to
having read and disseminated
the writings of Wycliffe.</p>

<p class="caption">JOHN HUSS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was required to denounce the English reformer as one of the
souls of the lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If he be lost, then I could wish my soul were with his,&rsquo; he said
firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was pronounced to be heresy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The emperor declared that he was not obliged to keep his word to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
heretics, and that his promise to protect the life of the Bohemian was
no longer binding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was condemned to death. He was stripped of his priestly
robes, and the cup of the sacrament was taken from his hands with a
curse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I trust I shall drink of it this day in the kingdom of heaven,&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We devote thy soul to the devils in hell,&rsquo; was the answer of the
prelates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was led away, guarded by eight hundred horsemen, to a meadow
without the gates. Here he was burned alive, and triumphed in soul
amid the flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such was the end of John Huss, the Savonarola of Constance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made an excursion upon the lake. The appearance of the old
city from the water is one of the most beautiful that can meet the eye.
It seems more like an artist&rsquo;s dream than a reality,&mdash;floating towers
in a crystal atmosphere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lake is walled with mountains, and wears a chain of castle-like
towns, like a necklace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be delightful to spend a summer there. Excursions on
the steamers can be made at almost any time of the day. One can
visit in this way five different old countries,&mdash;Baden, W&uuml;rtemberg,
Bavaria, Austria, and Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpadt">Mr. Beal&rsquo;s succinct account of the old city led to a discussion of the
gains of civilization from martyrdoms for principle and progress. He
was followed by Master Lewis, who gave the Class some account of</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">BISMARCK AND THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>In the eyes of the multitude, Bismarck is a great but unscrupulous statesman,
intent upon uniting Germany and making it the leading nation of Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
As a man, he seems hard-headed, self-willed, and iron-handed. As a ruler, he
is looked upon as the incarnation of the despotic spirit,&mdash;a believer in force,
an infidel as to moral suasion.</p>

<p>Many persons who sympathize with his policy censure the means by which
he executes it. They do not consider that so long as that policy is threatened
from within and without, the Chancellor must trust in force; nor do they read
the lesson of the centuries,&mdash;<em>Force</em> must rule until <em>Right</em> reigns.</p>

<p>The fact is not apprehended by the unthinking multitude, that the work of
grafting a statesman&rsquo;s policy into the life of a nation requires, like grafting a
fruit-tree, excision, incision, pressure, and time.</p>

<p>But it is not of Bismarck&rsquo;s policy I would first speak, but of that which few
credit him with possessing,&mdash;his moral convictions. Strange as it may seem to
those who know only
the Chancellor, Bismarck
is not only a
religious man, but
his religion is the
foundation of his
policy.</p>

<p>Dr. Busch, one
of the statesman&rsquo;s
secretaries, in a recent
book, &ldquo;Bismarck
in the Franco-German
War,&rdquo; narrates
incidents and
reports private conversations
which justify
this assertion.</p>

<p>On the eve of his
leaving Berlin to join
the army, the Chancellor
partook of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The
solemn rite was celebrated
in his own room, that it might not appear as an exhibition of official
piety.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 400px;">
<a name="bismarck" id="bismarck"></a>
<img src="images/zjnl030.jpg" width="400" height="388" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">BISMARCK.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>One morning Bismarck was called suddenly from his bed to see a French
general. Dr. Busch, on entering the bedroom just after the chief had left it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
found everything in disorder. On the floor was a book of devotion, &ldquo;Daily
Watchwords and Texts of the Moravian Brethren for 1870.&rdquo; On the table by
the bed was another, &ldquo;Daily Refreshment for Believing Christians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chancellor reads in them every night,&rdquo; said Bismarck&rsquo;s valet to Dr.
Busch, seeing his surprise.</p>

<p>One day, while dining with his staff, several of whom were &ldquo;free-thinkers,&rdquo;
Bismarck turned the conversation into a serious vein. A secretary had spoken
of the feeling of duty which pervaded the German army, from the private to the
general.</p>

<p>Bismarck caught the idea and tossed it still higher. &ldquo;The feeling of duty,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;in a man who submits to be shot dead on his post, alone, in the dark,
is due to what is left of belief in our people. He knows that there is Some One
who sees him when the lieutenant does not see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe, Your Excellency,&rdquo; asked a secretary, &ldquo;that they really reflect
on this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reflect? no: it is a feeling, a tone, an instinct. If they reflect they lose
it. Then they talk themselves out of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; Bismarck continued, &ldquo;without faith in a revealed religion, in a God
who wills what is good, in a Supreme Judge, and in a future life, men can live
together harmoniously, each doing his duty and letting every one else do his, I
do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause in the conversation, and the Chancellor then gave expression
to his faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were no longer a Christian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would not remain for an hour
at my post. If I could not count upon my God, assuredly I should not do so on
earthly masters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;disturb myself and work unceasingly in this
world, exposing myself to all sorts of vexations, if I had not the feeling that I
must do my duty for God&rsquo;s sake? If I did not believe in a Divine order, which
has destined this German nation for something good and great, I would at once
give up the business of a diplomatist. Orders and titles have no charm for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was another pause, for the staff were silent before this revelation of
their chief&rsquo;s inner life. He continued to lay bare the foundations of his statesmanship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe the firmness which I have shown for ten years against all possible
absurdities only to my decided faith. Take from me this faith, and you take
from me my fatherland. If I were not a believing Christian, if I had not the
supernatural basis of religion, you would not have had such a Chancellor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I delight in country life, in the woods, and in nature,&rdquo; he said, in the course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of the conversation. &ldquo;Take from me my relation to God, and I am the man who
will pack up to-morrow and be off to Varzin [his farm] to grow my oats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surprise with which these revelations of a statesman&rsquo;s inner life are
read is due to their singularity. Neither history nor biography is so full of
instances of statesmen confessing their faith in God and in Christianity, at a
dinner-table surrounded by &ldquo;free-thinkers,&rdquo; as to prevent the reading of these
revelations from being both interesting and stimulating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I live among heathen,&rdquo; said the Chancellor, as he concluded this acknowledgment
that his religion was the basis of his statesmanship. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seek to
make proselytes, but I am obliged to confess my faith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince von Bismarck was born in 1813. His political history is similar to
Emperor William&rsquo;s, which I related at our last meeting. The Emperor and his
Chancellor, in matters of state, have been as one man. Each has aimed to secure
the unity of the German empire. Each has sought to disarm, on the one hand,
that branch of the Catholic party who give their allegiance to Rome rather than
the government, the so-called Ultramontanes; and the Socialists, on the other
hand, who would overthrow the monarchy. The two strong men have ruled
with a firm hand, but with much wisdom. Germany could hardly have a more
liberal government, unless she became a republic.</p>

<p class="hrpadt">The stories of the evening were chiefly selected from Hoffman.
They were too long and terrible to be given here. Among them were
&ldquo;The Painter&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Elementary Spirit.&rdquo; In introducing these
stories, Mr. Beal related some touching and strange incidents of their
author.</p>

<p>Hoffman died in Berlin. His career as a musical artist had been associated
with the Prussian-Polish provinces, where he seems to have acquired habits of
dissipation in brilliant but gay musical society.</p>

<p>Hoffman had exquisite refinement of taste, and sensitiveness to the beautiful
in nature and art, but the exhilaration of the wine-cup was to him a fatal knowledge.
It made him in the end a poor, despised, inferior man.</p>

<p>As he lost his self-mastery, he also seemed to lose his self-respect. He
mingled with the depraved, and carried the consciousness of his inferiority into
all his associations with better society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I once saw Hoffman,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;in one of his night carouses. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sitting in his glory at the head of the table, not stupidly drunk, but warmed with
wine, which made him madly eloquent. There, in full tide of witty discourse, or,
if silent, his hawk eye flashing beneath his matted hair, sat this unfortunate
genius until the day began to dawn; then he found his way homeward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At such hours he used to write his wild, fantastic tales. To his excited
fancy everything around him had a spectral look. The shadows of fevered
thought stalked like ghosts through his soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This stimulated life came to a speedy conclusion. He was struck with a
most strange paralysis at the age of forty-six.</p>

<p>His disease first paralyzed his hands and feet, then his arms and legs, then
his whole body, except his brain and vital organs.</p>

<p>In this condition it was remarked in his presence that death was not the
worst of evils. He stared wildly and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life, life, only life,&mdash;on any condition whatsoever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His whole hope was centred in the gay world which had already become to
him as a picture of the past.</p>

<p>But the hour came at last when he knew he must die. He asked his wife to
fold his useless hands on his breast, and, looking at her pitifully, he said, &ldquo;And
we must think of God also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Religion, in his gay years, as a provincial musician, and as a poet in the
thoughtless society of the capital, had seldom occupied his thoughts.</p>

<p>His last thought was given to the subject which should have claimed the
earliest and best efforts of his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God also!&rdquo; It was his farewell to the world. The demons had done their
work. Life&rsquo;s opportunities were ended.</p>

<p>The words of his afterthought echo after him, and, like his own weird stories,
have their lesson.</p>
</div>


<p class="hrpadt">Herman Reed presented a story from a more careful writer. It
is a story with an aim, and left an impressive lesson on the minds of
all. If it be somewhat of an allegory, it is one whose meaning it is
not hard to comprehend.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE HEART OF STONE.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The Black Forest, from time out of mind, has abounded with stories of phantoms,
demons, genii, and fairies. The dark hue of the hills, the shadowy and
mysterious recesses, the lonely ways, the beautiful glens, all tend to suggest the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
legends that are associated with every mountain, valley, and town. The old
legends have filled volumes. One of the most popular of recent stories of the
Black Forest is the &ldquo;Marble Heart; or, the Stone-cold Heart,&rdquo; by Hauff.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Hauff, a writer of wonderful precocity, genius, and invention, was
born at Stuttgart in 1809. He was designed for the theological profession, and
entered the University of T&uuml;bingen in 1820. He had a taste for popular legends,
and published many allegorical works. He died before he had completed his
twenty-sixth year.</p>

<p>There once lived a widow in the Black Forest, whose name was Frau Barbara
Munk. She had a boy, sixteen years old, named Peter, who was put to the
trade of charcoal-burner, a common occupation in the Black Forest.</p>

<p>Now a charcoal-burner has much time for reflection; and as Peter sat at his
stack, with the dark trees around him, he began to cherish a longing to become
rich and powerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A black, lonely charcoal-burner,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;leads a wretched
life. How much more respected are the glass-blowers, the clock-makers, and
the musicians!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The raftsmen of the forest, too, excited his envy. They passed like giants
through the towns, with their silver buckles, consequential looks, and clay pipes,
often a yard long. There were three of these timber-dealers that he particularly
admired. One of them, called &ldquo;Fat Hesekiel,&rdquo; seemed like a mint of gold,
so freely did he use his money at the gaming-tables at the tavern. The second,
called &ldquo;Stout Schlurker,&rdquo; was both rich and dictatorial; and the third was a
famous dancer.</p>

<p>These traders were from Holland. Peter Munk, the young coal-burner,
used to think of them and their good fortune, when sitting alone in the pine
forests. The Black Foresters were people rich in generous character and right
principle, but very poor in purse. Peter began to look upon them and their
homely occupations with contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will do no longer,&rdquo; said Peter, one day. &ldquo;I must thrive or die. Oh,
that I were as much regarded as rich Hesekiel or powerful Schlurker, or even
as the King of the Dancers! I wonder where they obtain their money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were two Forest spirits, of whom Peter had heard, that were said
to help those who sought them to riches and honor. One was Glassmanikin, a
good little dwarf; and the other was Michael the Dutchman,&mdash;dark, dangerous,
terrible, and powerful,&mdash;a giant ghost.</p>

<p>Peter had heard that there was a magic verse, which, were he to repeat it
alone in the forest, would cause the benevolent dwarf, Glassmanikin, to appear.
Three of the lines were well known,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O treasure-guarder, &rsquo;mid the forests green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many, full many a century hast thou seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine are the lands where rise the dusky pine&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He did not know the last line,
and, as he was but a poor poet, he was
unable to make a line to fill the sense,
metre, and rhyme.</p>

<p>He inquired of the Black Foresters about
the missing line, but they only knew as much
as he, else many of them would have called the fairy
banker to their own service.</p>

<p>One day, as he was alone in the forest, he resolved
to repeat, over and over, the magic lines,
hoping that the fourth line would in some way occur
to him.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O treasure-guarder, &rsquo;mid the forests green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many, full many a century hast thou seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine are the regions of the dusky pine.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As he said these words he saw, to his astonishment,
a little fellow peep around the trunk of a tree;
but, as the fourth line did not come to him, Mr. Glassmanikin
disappeared.</p>

<p>Peter went home, with his mind full of visions.
Oh, that he were a poet! He consulted
the oldest wood-cutters, but none of them could
supply the missing line.</p>

<p>Soon after, Peter again went into the
deep forest, his brain aching for a
rhyme with <em>pine</em>. As he was hurrying
along, a gigantic man, with
a pole as big as a mast over his
shoulder, appeared from behind
the pine-trees. Peter was filled
with terror, for he felt that it was
none other than the giant-gnome,
Michael the Dutchman.</p>

alt="Peter in the forest" />
</div>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>&ldquo;Peter Munk, what doest thou
here?&rdquo; he thundered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
&ldquo;I want to pass this road on business,&rdquo; said Peter, in increasing alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou liest. Peter, you are a miserable wight, but I pity you. You want
money. Accept my <em>conditions</em>, and I will help you. How many hundred thalers
do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, sir; but I&rsquo;ll have no dealings with you: I am afraid of your <em>conditions</em>.
I have heard of you already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter began to run.</p>

<p>The giant strode after him; but there was a magic circle in the forest that
he could not pass, and, as he was near it, Peter was able to escape.</p>

<p>A great secret had been revealed to Peter, and he now thought he had the
clew to the charm. The good dwarf, Glassmanikin, only helped people who
were born on Sunday.</p>

<p>Possessed of this fact, Peter again ventured on into the deep forest. He
found himself at last under a huge pine. He stopped there to rest, when suddenly
a perfect line and rhyme occurred to him. He leaped into the air with
joy, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O treasure-guarder, &rsquo;mid the forests green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many, full many a century hast thou seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine are the regions of the dusky pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And children born on Sabbath-days are thine.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>A little old manikin arose from the earth at the foot of the pine. He wore
a black jerkin, red stockings, and a peaked hat. His face had a kindly expression,
and he sat down and began to smoke a blue glass pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter, Peter,&rdquo; said the fairy, &ldquo;I should be sorry to think that the love of
idleness has brought you hither to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I know that with idleness vice begins. But I would like a better
trade. It is a low thing to be a charcoal-burner. I would like to become a
glass-blower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To every Sunday-child who seeks my aid, I grant three wishes. If, however,
the last wish is a foolish one, I cannot grant it. Peter, Peter, what are
your wishes? Let them be good and useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to dance better than the King of Dancers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Secondly, I would always have as much money in my pocket as &lsquo;Fat
Hesekiel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor lad!&rdquo; said the gnome sadly. &ldquo;What despicable things to
wish for! To dance well, and have money to gamble! What is your third
wish?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
&ldquo;I should like to own the finest glass factory in the forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O stupid Charcoal Peter! you should have wished for wisdom. Wealth is
useless without wisdom
to use it. Here
are two thousand
guldens. Go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter returned
home. At the frolics
at the inn, he
surpassed the King
of Dancers in dancing,
and he was
hailed with great
admiration by the
young. He began
to gamble at the
ale-houses, and was
able to produce as
much money as Fat
Hesekiel himself.
People wondered.
He next ordered a
glass factory to be
built, and in a few
months Peter Munk
was rich and famous
and envied. People
said he had found a
hidden treasure.</p>

<p>But Peter did
not know how to use
his money. He
spent it at the alehouse;
and at last,
when the money in
the pockets of Fat Hesekiel, for some reason, was low, he was unable to pay
his debts, and the bailiffs came to take him to prison.</p>

<p class="caption">PETER AND THE MANIKIN.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>In his troubles he resolved to go again into the deep forest, and seek the
aid of the forest gnomes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
&ldquo;If the good little gnome will not help me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the big one will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he passed along, ashamed
of his conduct in not having better
deserved of the good fairy, he
began to cry,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael the Dutchman! Michael
the Dutchman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments the giant
raftsman stood before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to me at last,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Go with me to my
house, and I will show you how
I can be of service to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter followed the giant to
some steep rocks, and down into
an abyss; there was the gnome&rsquo;s
palace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your difficulties come from
<em>here</em>,&rdquo; said the gnome, placing his
hands over the young man&rsquo;s heart.
&ldquo;Let me have your heart, and you
shall have riches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give you my heart?&rdquo; said
Peter; &ldquo;I should die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led Peter into a great
closet, where were jars filled with
liquid. In them were the hearts
of many who had become rich.
Among them were the hearts of
the King of the Dancers and of
Fat Hesekiel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hinderance to wealth is
feeling. I have taken, as you see,
the hearts of these rich men. I
have replaced them by hearts of
stone. You see how <em>they</em> flourish.
<em>You</em> may do the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A heart of stone must feel very cold within,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

&ldquo;But what is the use of a heart of feeling, with poverty? Give me your
heart, and I will make you rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

<p>The giant gave him a drug, which caused stupor. When Peter awoke from
the stupor his heart seemed
cold. He put his hand on
his breast: there was no
motion. Then he knew
that he had indeed a heart
of stone.</p>

<p>Nothing now brought
him pleasure or delight.
He loved nothing; pitied
no one&rsquo;s misfortunes.
Beauty was nothing. He
cared not for relatives or
friends; but he had
money, money. The supply
never failed.</p>

<p>He travelled over the
world, but everything
seemed dead to him. Sentiment
was dead within
him. He lied, he cheated.
He filled many homes with
wretchedness and ruin.</p>

<p>At last he became
weary of life.</p>

<p>The Glassmanikin came up again, as before. He met Peter with an injured
look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
&ldquo;What wouldst thou?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That thou shouldst give me a feeling heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot. I am not Michael the Dutchman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can live no longer with this stone heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pity you. Take this cross, and go to Michael. Get him to give you back
your heart, under some pretext, and when he demands it again show him this
cross, and he will be powerless to harm you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peter took the cross and hurried into the deep forest. He called,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael the Dutchman! Michael the Dutchman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now, Peter Munk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is feeling in my heart. Give me another. You have been deceiving
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to my closet, and we will see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gnome took out the stone heart, and replaced it for a moment by the
old heart from the jar. It began to beat. Peter felt joy again. How happy
he was! A heart, even with poverty, seemed the greatest of blessings. He
would not exchange his heart again for the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have it now,&rdquo; said the gnome.</p>

<p>But Peter held out the cross. The gnome shrank away, faded, and disappeared.</p>

<p>Peter put his hand on his breast. His heart was beating. He became
a wise, thrifty, and prosperous man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>NIGHT SECOND.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">Seven Nights on the Rhine:&mdash;Basle.&mdash;Marshal Von Moltke.&mdash;The Story of
the Enchanted Hen.</p>


<p><span class="dcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>UR second night on the Rhine was passed at Basle.
Leaving Lake Constance, the Rhine, full of vivid
life, starts on its way to the sea. At the Rhinefall
at Schaffhausen the water scenery becomes
noble and exciting. A gigantic rock, over three
hundred feet wide, impedes the course of the river,
and over it the waters leap and eddy and foam, and then flow calmly
on amid green woods, and near villages whose windows glitter in
the sun.</p>

<p>We rode through the so-called Forest towns. High beeches stood
on each side of the river, and the waters here were as blue as the sky,
and so clear we could see the gravelly bed.</p>

<p>The river hastened to Basle. We hastened on like the river.
Basle is the first town of importance on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Here we obtained a fine view of the Black Forest range of hills,
and beheld the distant summits of the Jura and the Vosges.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A VILLAGE IN THE BLACK FOREST.</p>

<p>Basle was a Roman fortified town in the days of the struggles of
Rome with the Barbarians. It is gray with history,&mdash;with the battles
of Church and State, battles of words, and battles of deeds and
blood. But the sunlight was poured upon it, and the Rhine flowed
quietly by, and the palaces of peace and prosperity rose on every hand,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"><!-- blank page --></a></span>

as though the passions of men had never been excited there, or the soil
reddened with blood.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">PEASANT&rsquo;S HOUSE IN THE BLACK FOREST.</p>

<p>We took a principal street on our arrival, and followed the
uncertain way. It led to the cathedral, on high ground. At the entrance
to the grand old church stood the figures of St. George and St.
Martin on prancing horses. The interior was high and lofty, with an
imposing organ. Here we read on one of the tombs, &ldquo;Erasmus of
Rotterdam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The famous Black Forest is comprised within the lines of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
isosceles triangle, which has Basle and Constance at each end of the line
of base. The Rhine turns toward the north at Basle, and very nearly
follows two lines of the figure. The forest covers an area of about
twelve hundred square miles. It is a romantic seclusion, having Basle,
Freiburg, and Baden-Baden for its cities of supply and exchange; full
of pastoral richness, lonely grandeur; a land of fable and song.</p>

<p>The Black Forest Railway is one of the great triumphs of engineering
skill. It is ninety-three miles long, and has some forty tunnels.
It takes the traveller from Baden at once into the primeval solitudes.
Freiburg, a very quaint town, is situated in the forest.</p>


<p class="hrpadt">Master Lewis spoke briefly to the Club of Von Moltke, the great
Prussian general.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">MARSHAL VON MOLTKE.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Never was a nation more fortunate in its leaders than was Prussia when she
aimed to achieve German unity. It is often the case that when some great
crisis comes upon a country, men able to deal with it rise and become the guides
of the people. This was never more true than it was of Prussia when, thirteen
years ago, she entered upon the war with France which was to decide not only
her own destiny, but that of the whole German people.</p>

<p>Three Prussians towered, at that time, far above the rest,&mdash;William, the
wise and energetic king; Bismarck, the resolute and far-seeing statesman; and
Von Moltke, the skilful and consummate soldier. It was the united action of
these three, as much as the valor of the Prussian army, which not only won the
victory, but gathered and garnered its fruits.</p>

<p>All three of these men are still living (1882-83), and still active, each in his
own sphere. The hale old king, now emperor, shows, at the age of eighty-six,
little lessening of his sturdy powers. Bismarck, at seventy, still sways
with his strong and stubborn will the affairs of the youthful empire. Von
Moltke, at eighty-two, remains the foremost military figure of Germany.</p>

<p>Von Moltke is a very interesting personage. From his earliest youth he has
followed the profession of arms. He has always been every inch a soldier.
In the course of years, he became an absolute master of his art. He had military
science at his fingers&rsquo; ends. In every emergency he knew just what to do.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 397px;">
<a name="von_moltke" id="von_moltke"></a>
<img src="images/zjnl037.jpg" width="397" height="500" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">VON MOLTKE.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>To be sure, he has not been one of those brilliant and dashing military
chiefs who, by their daring exploits and sudden triumphs, become heroes in the
eyes of men. He has been a careful, studious, deliberate commander, losing
sight of nothing, ready for every exigency, looking well ahead, and closely
calculating upon every possibility of events.</p>

<p>Yet the sturdy old soldier is by no means a dull man outside of his quarters
or the barracks. In a quiet way, he enjoys life in many of its phases. He has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
always been a great reader on a great variety of subjects. He is known as one
of the most delightful letter-writers in Germany. He is fond, too, of poetry, and
reads history and fiction with much delight.</p>

<p>There is a Roman simplicity about Von Moltke&rsquo;s daily life. He lives in a
building which serves as the headquarters of the general staff of the army in
Berlin. Promptly at seven o&rsquo;clock every morning, summer and winter, he enters
his study, a plain room, with a table in the centre, covered with maps, papers,
and books.</p>

<p>There he takes his coffee, at the same time smoking a cigar. He proceeds
at once to work, and keeps at it till nine, when his mail is brought to him. At
eleven he takes a plain breakfast, after which he again works steadily till two,
when he holds a reception of officers.</p>

<p>The afternoon is devoted to work. After dinner, for the first time, this man of
eighty-two enjoys some rest and recreation until eleven, at which hour he retires.</p>

<p>In personal appearance, Von Moltke is tall, thin, and slightly stooping. On
horseback, however, he straightens up, and bears himself as erect as a man of
thirty. His close-shaven face is much wrinkled, and his profile somewhat
reminds one of that of Julius C&aelig;sar. He never appears in any other than a
military dress; and is often seen walking alone in the Thiergarten at Berlin, his
hands clasped behind him and his head bent forward, after the manner of the
great Napoleon.</p>

<p>Von Moltke married, some years ago, an English girl many years younger
than himself. She died suddenly in 1868; and this event cast a shadow over
all his later life. He has always since worn a sad and thoughtful face. He
often visits his wife&rsquo;s grave in the country; and on the mausoleum which he
erected to her memory, he has caused to be engraved the sentence, &ldquo;Love is the
fulfilling of the law.&rdquo;</p>
</div>


<p class="hrpadt">The rest of the evening was spent in rehearsing Black Forest tales,
one of the most interesting of which we give here.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">SCRATCH GRAVEL; OR, THE ENCHANTED HEN.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Queer stories, as well as tragic ones, are related of the Black Forest; and one
of the most popular legends of enchantment, the Hen Trench, is as absurd as it
is amusing. Children like this story, for among German children the industrious
and useful hen is something of a pet. Where, except in Germany, did there ever
originate an heroic legend of a <em>hen</em>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
The main line of the Baden railway runs southward towards Freiburg, amid
some of the most picturesque mountain scenery of the Black Forest. The
second station is B&uuml;hl,
from which a delightful
excursion may be
made to Forbach and
the Murg Valley.</p>

<p>Here may be seen
the extensive ruins of
the old castle of Windeck,
which was destroyed
in the year
1561, about which a
very remarkable story
is told.</p>

<p>The old lords of
Windeck were very
quarrelsome people.
They had feud after
feud with the neighboring
lords, and were

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Queer times were
those, and queer relations
existed between
the Church and State.
The Lord of Windeck
was at one time kidnapped
by the Bishop
of Strasburg, and confined
in a tower three
years,&mdash;a thing that
would not be regarded
as a very clerical or
spiritual proceeding to-day. A little later the Dean of Strasburg was surprised
by the retainers of the Lord of Windeck, and was in turn carried a prisoner to
the gray old castle of Windeck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
The captive dean had a niece, a lovely girl, who was deeply attached to him.
When she heard of his captivity she was much grieved, and set herself to
devising plans for his release.</p>

<p>At the foot of the grim old castle, in the Black Forest, there lived an old
woman. She was wiser than her neighbors, and was regarded as a witch. She
was able to tell inquirers whatever they wished to know, and so was as useful
as a newspaper, in her day and generation.</p>

<p>She was the last of her family. She lived alone, and her only society was
some pure white hens, so large that the biggest of modern Shanghai fowls must
have been mere pygmies to them.</p>

<p>The people of the region were very shy of the old woman and her strange
hens. The timid never ventured past her door after dark, after her hens went
to roost.</p>

<p>She was surprised one winter evening by a rap at her door.</p>

<p>She listened.</p>

<p>Tap, tap, tap!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fair young girl lifted the latch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am belated in the forest. Will you give me shelter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in and sit down. Whence did you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am on my way to the castle, but night has overtaken me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very near it. If it were light, I could show you its towers. But
what can a dove like you be seeking in that vulture&rsquo;s nest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear uncle, the Dean of Strasburg, is a prisoner there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him when he was dragged into the castle, and very distressed and
woe-begone the good man looked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going there to pray for his release.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umph. At that castle they don&rsquo;t give something for nothing. What ransom
can you offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I hope by prayers and tears to move the count&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am wiser than you in the world&rsquo;s ways,&mdash;let me advise you. Cry with
those pretty eyes, plead with your sweet voice, but not to the old count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To his son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he influence his father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girl, I have taken a liking to you. You have a kind heart; I can see your
disposition; I have met but few like you in the world. I will tell you what I
will do. I will give you one of my white hens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>hen</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes. Go with the hen to the castle and inquire for Bernard, the count&rsquo;s
son. Tell him that at daybreak the Count of Eberstein has planned an attack
on the castle, and that you have come to warn him. Bid him fear nothing. Say
that what he needs is a trench; and when he asks how one is to be made, tell
him that you have brought him Scratch Gravel, the hen, who will immediately
dig one for him.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>&ldquo;How will that rescue my uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden took the white hen, and went out into the night. The old
woman pointed out to her the way to the castle.</p>

<p>As she drew near the castle, she heard a great noise in the highway. The
count&rsquo;s son was returning late from the chase. As he drew near her on horseback,
he accosted her politely and asked her errand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The beautiful girl related the story the old woman had told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take you to my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She related her story to the count, and showed
him the white hen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! pooh!&rdquo; said the count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think her story is true,&rdquo; said the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see truth written on her beautiful
face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? I don&rsquo;t see it. Perhaps
my eyes are not as good as they used to
be. Well, well; let us see what the white
hen will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They took the hen outside the castle,
and put her down. Presently the gravel
began to fly. It was like a storm. The
air was filled with earth and stones, and
the old count was filled with astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hen is bewitched,&rdquo; said the
count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you that the
girl is honest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And handsome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before daybreak the white
hen had dug a deep trench
around the castle. The trench
is shown to travellers to-day,
a very remarkable proof of the
truth of the story, with only
one missing link in the chain
of evidence.</p>

<p>The next morning the enemy
appeared, but when he
came to the trench he forbore
to storm the castle.</p>

</div>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The old count called the
maiden into his presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
&ldquo;What reward do you ask for so great a service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you call the Dean of Strasburg to give thanks in the chapel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The count called the bishop, and attended the service. When it was over,
he did not remand the good man to his cell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have one request to make of you,&rdquo; said Bernard to the maid, as they left
the church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promise to grant it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you make your home in the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On one condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That the dean is released.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young count went to his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The maiden has one request to make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall have her request.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the dean was released and went back to Strasburg. The maid became
the wife of the young count, but what became of the hen the chroniclers do not
tell.</p>

<p>But the trench remains,&mdash;the <i>Henne-Graben</i>,&mdash;and all that is wanting to
make the evidence of the story sure is to connect the hen with the trench, after
four hundred years. This may not be hard; geologists make connections in like
cases after the lapse of a thousand years. Do they not?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>EVENING THE THIRD.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">Strasburg.&mdash;A Memorable Christmas.&mdash;The Story of the Lost Organist.</p>


<p><span class="dcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>UR third night upon the Rhine was spent at Strasburg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cathedral is the wonder of the city. The
excursionist thinks of but little else during his
stay there. Wherever he may be, the gigantic
church is always in view. He beholds it towering
over all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its history is that of Germany. It grew with the German empire,
and has shared all its triumphs and reverses. It was founded by Clovis.
It has been imperilled by lightning some fifty times, and has as often
repelled the shocks of war. In the tenth century it was burned;
in the eleventh, plundered; and five years after it was nearly demolished
by lightning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was after the last calamity that the present structure was begun.
At one time a <em>hundred thousand</em> men were employed upon it: can we
wonder that it is colossal?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The giant grew. In 1140, 1150, and 1176 it was partly burned,
but it rose from the flames always more great, lofty, and splendid.</p>

<p class="caption">STRASBURG CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indulgences were offered to donors and workmen; to contributors
of all kinds. Men earned, or thought they earned, their salvation by
adding their mites to the spreading magnificence. In 1303 it is said
that all the peasants of Alsace might be seen drawing stone into Strasburg

for the cathedral. Master builder succeeded master builder,&mdash;died,&mdash;but
the great work went on. In the French Revolution the
Jacobins tore from the cathedral the statues of two hundred and thirty
saints; but it was still a city of saints in stone and marble. In 1870,
in the Franco-Prussian war, its roof was perforated with shells, and on
the 25th of August it burst into flames, and it was telegraphed over
the world that the great cathedral was destroyed. But it stands to-day,
majestic, regal, and beautiful, its spire piercing the sky.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATFORM OF STRASBURG CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We visited the cathedral in the afternoon. We were at once filled
with wonder at the windows. They burned with color, and seemed to
hang in air amid the shadows of the lofty walls. They represented
scriptural subjects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was standing in awe, gazing upon a gorgeous circular window
that seemed to blaze in the air like a planet, when Charlie touched my
arm.</p>

of art that it has taken a thousand years to build.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; I hope we shall be here to-morrow when the Twelve Apostles
come out and the cock crows <em>at</em> Peter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">A MEMORABLE CHRISTMAS.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The soldiers of Aurelian, the Roman emperor, used to sing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;We have slain a thousand Franks.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;We have cut off the heads of a thousand, thousand, thousand, thousand.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">May he live a thousand years.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Franks came out of the North, and established themselves in Gaul and
Germania during the period of the early Roman emperors. Their most
renowned king was Clovis, with whom began the empire of France. He was
a savage and passionate man, born to command and to conquer. He was a
heathen. It is related of him that once, when he had enriched himself with
spoils from some of the early Christian churches, the Bishop of Rheims desired
that he would return a valued vase that had been taken from the cathedral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow us to Soissons,&rdquo; said Clovis; &ldquo;there the booty will be divided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the division of the booty, a high-spirited and selfish Frankish chieftain
objected to the bishop&rsquo;s claim, and, to show his contempt for him and the
Church, struck the vase with his battle-axe. Clovis was offended. He gave
the bishop the vase, and soon after avenged the insult by striking the chieftain
dead with his own battle-axe, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus didst thou to the vase at Soissons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife, Clotilde, was a Christian, and she often tried to persuade him to
embrace the Christian faith.</p>

<p>In 496 the Allemannians, a German confederation, who had been assailing
the Roman colonies on the Rhine, crossed the river, and invaded the territory
of the Franks. Clovis met the invaders near Cologne. A severe battle followed.
Clovis was hard pressed.</p>

He called upon his gods, but they did not answer him. He saw he was in
danger of being utterly defeated and losing his army.</p>

<p>He had with him a servant of the queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord King,&rdquo; said this man, &ldquo;believe only on the Lord of heaven,
whom the queen, my

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Christmas Day, 496, will be ever memorable in Christian history; it was on
that day that the King of the Franks was baptized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
The occasion was one of barbaric splendor, and such as might be expected
of a warlike king in those rude times. The road from the palace to the baptistery,
over which the king was to pass, was curtained with silk, mottoes, and
banners, like a triumphal way. The houses of Rheims were hung with festive
ornaments, and the baptistery itself was sprinkled with balm and &ldquo;all manner of
perfume.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The procession moved from the palace like a pageant for a feast of victory.
The clergy led, bearing the Gospels, standards, and cross. Hymns were chanted,
as they swept along. Then came the Bishop of Rheims, leading the king; after
him, the rejoicing queen; and lastly the neophytes who were to receive baptism
with the king.</p>

<p>On the way, the king seemed impressed with the glittering pageant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this kingdom promised me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the bishop; &ldquo;but it is the entrance to the road that leads to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the baptistery the bishop said to the king,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lower your head with humility; adore what thou hast burned; burn what
thou hast adored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clovis was then solemnly baptized, and with him three thousand warriors.
With the imposing rite, Christianity in France began, and with him began that
great monument of the faith, Strasburg Cathedral.</p>

<p class="hrpadt">Charlie Leland furnished the most interesting story on this evening.
It well illustrated features of German and French musical life
that are unknown in America. In Germany and in the French provinces
the organist of the town is a very important person. The choice
of an organist in these towns is a very interesting event, and during
the last century excited more discussion than at the present time.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE YOUNG ORGANIST: A MYSTERY.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The towns on the Rhine are all famous for their organs, and proud of the
eminent organists they have had in the past. Each town points with pride to
some musical legend and history.</p>

<p>The story I have to tell is associated with an ancient provincial town.</p>

<p>It is now hardly more than a small town, and possesses not above a thousand
inhabitants; but in the latter part of the last century it was more than ten times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"><!-- illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
its present size, and its church, now in ruins, was then one of the most beautiful
ever seen in that part of the country.</p>

<p>This church was finished in the year 1795, and was for a long time the great
object of curiosity for miles around. It was of the Gothic and Romanesque
style of architecture, and was not only finely proportioned on the exterior, but
had within a magnificence of decoration that astonished one more and more
the longer he gazed upon it.</p>

<p>The church, unlike some of the older ones standing at that time, had a magnificent
organ. This had been paid for by a separate subscription, raised in
small sums by the common people, and, having been built by skilful workmen in
Bordeaux, was at length set up in the church amid considerable enthusiasm and
excitement.</p>

<p>But who should play this grand instrument? How should a competent
organist be selected?</p>

<p>The people were greatly interested in the matter, and discussed it on the
corner of the <i>rues</i>, in the <i>brasseries</i> or taverns; and for a period of six or eight
weeks you might be sure, if you saw more than two people talking earnestly
together, that they were deliberating upon the choice of an organist.</p>

<p>Since the people, both high and low, had so freely contributed for the purchase
of the organ, it was thought very proper that they should be allowed to
choose a person to play it. And, the decision being thus left to the multitude,
the most feasible plan that was suggested was that all should go, on an
appointed day, to the church, and should then listen to the playing of the various
candidates.</p>

<p>There were, in all, nearly a score of aspiring musicians in and near the town;
and each of these, hoping for a favorable decision for himself, gave no end of
little suppers and parties, so that the influential ones among the townsmen fared
sumptuously from all.</p>

<p>But out of the entire number there were two, between whom the choice
really lay. These were Baptiste Lacombe and Raoul Tegot.</p>

<p>The former of these had lived in the town only five years. He had come
from Bruges, so he said; and although he astonished everybody by his skill, he
had not been liked from the first. He was very reserved and parsimonious, and
his eye never met frankly the person with whom he talked. But no harm was
known of him, and he found in Tranteigue plenty of exercise for his art.</p>

<p>Raoul Tegot, on the contrary, was a native of the town; and, together with
his young son, Fran&ccedil;ois, was beloved by all. He had married one of the village
maidens, and had been so inconsolable at her death, which occurred when Fran&ccedil;ois
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
was a baby, that he never thought more of marriage, but devoted himself
to his child and
his art.</p>

<p>He was certainly
a very able
musician, and,
being so universally
liked, many
people urged that
a public performance
be dispensed
with, and that he
be elected at
once. But although
Baptiste
Lacombe was not
<em>liked</em>, his <em>skill</em>
found many admirers;
and, besides,
it was flattering
to the
worthy countryfolk
to think of
sitting solemnly
in judgment at
the great church;
and so the proposed
plan was
adhered to.</p>

</div>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Finally, the
weeks of anticipation
came to
an end, the appointed
day was
at hand, and, according
to the arrangements previously made, at nine o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon
the three great doors of the church were swung open, and the throng, orderly
and even dignified, entered and filled the edifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The seats, which in French churches and cathedrals are movable, had all
been taken away, and the crowd quite filled the whole space. All male inhabitants
of the town who were over twenty years of age were to vote, and each, the
town officials and the poorest artisans alike, had one ballot.</p>

<p>The great and beautiful organ took up nearly the whole of the large gallery
over the entrance, and extended up and up into the clear-story until it was
mingled with the supports of the roof.</p>

<p>In the organ-loft the candidates were crowded together in eager expectation,
and the glances that passed from one to another were not the kindliest. Each
of them had been allowed several hours, at some time during the past week, for
practice on the instrument; and each doubtless considered himself deserving of
the position.</p>

<p>Presently, when all was still, Monseigneur Jules &Eacute;mile Gautier, a very learned
gentleman of the town, who had been chosen for that purpose, ascended two
steps of the stairway which curved up and around the richly carved pulpit, and
announced the name of the person who was to begin.</p>

<p>I should not be able to give, in detail, the progress of the trial; for the history
of the affair is not minute enough for that. But suffice it to say that the last
name on the list was Raoul Tegot; and the name immediately preceding it was
that of Baptiste Lacombe.</p>

<p>At length, in his turn, Monsieur Lacombe, his iron-gray hair disordered, his
hands rubbing together nervously, and his eyes flashing&mdash;as was afterwards
remarked upon&mdash;with a malicious fire, stepped forward and along to the organ-seat,
and for a few moments arranged his stops.</p>

<p>Then he began lightly and delicately, creeping up through the varied registers
of the noble instrument, blending the beautiful sounds into wonderful
combinations, now and then working in a sweet melody, and then again upward
until the grand harmonies of the full organ rolled forth. There was something
mysterious and awe-inspiring in the effort. It seemed to the people that they
had never heard music before.</p>

<p>The music ceased. The people came back to their prosaic selves again,
looked in each other&rsquo;s faces, and said, with one breath, &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gradually they recovered their sober judgment, and then, mingled with the
murmurs of admiration, were heard the remarks, &ldquo;That is fine, but Raoul Tegot
will make us forget it!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, wait until you hear Raoul Tegot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon Gautier ascended the two steps of the pulpit, and called the name of
their kind, generous townsman.</p>

<p>All waited breathlessly. All eyes were turned towards the organ-loft. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
musicians there looked around and at each other. But poor Raoul Tegot could
not be seen.</p>

<p>Where was he? The people waited and wondered, but he did not come.
Monsieur Baptiste Lacombe was greatly excited, and was wiping the perspiration
from his heated face. &ldquo;Perhaps he was afraid to come,&rdquo; he ventured to remark
to a man near him, at the same time looking out of a window.</p>

<p>Several noticed his agitation; but they only said, &ldquo;Ah, mon Dieu, how he
did play! No wonder that he is nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The disquiet and confusion in the nave and aisles increased.</p>

<p>A messenger had been sent to look for the missing man; but he could not
be found.</p>

<p>What was to be done?</p>

<p>Finally, some friends of Monsieur Lacombe made bold to urge his immediate
election, declaring that he had far surpassed all competitors; and they even
hinted at cowardice on the part of Raoul Tegot.</p>

<p>This insinuation was indignantly denied by Tegot&rsquo;s friends, who were very
numerous but helpless; they knew their friend too well to believe him capable
of such conduct. He was, they said, probably detained somewhere by an
accident.</p>

<p>But, wherever he was, he was <em>not</em> present; and when a vote was taken,
hastily, by a showing of hands, Monsieur Baptiste Lacombe had ten times as
many ballots as any other person, and, of course, poor Monsieur Tegot, not having
competed, was not balloted for at all.</p>

<p>The people dispersed to their homes; some in vexation that their favorite
had not appeared, others in a little alarm at his strange absence. Young Fran&ccedil;ois
Tegot had not seen his father since early morning, and could not conjecture
where he might be.</p>

<p>The next day the missing organist did not appear, and his friends began to
inquire and to search for him; but they were wholly unsuccessful. A little
boy said that he had seen him go into the church with Monsieur Lacombe early
that morning; but Monsieur Lacombe said, very distinctly and with some vehemence,
that the missing man had left the church an hour later to go to a cottage
at the edge of the town, where he was to give a lesson in singing.</p>

<p>So the affair lay wrapped in mystery. There were many surmises, but nothing
definite was known. A few expressed suspicion of the rival candidate; but the
suspicion was too great to be thrown rashly upon anybody. Thus no progress
in the inquiry was made. A human life did not mean so much in those stormy
days after the Revolution as formerly; and the mysterious disappearance, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
being in the least cleared up, gradually faded from men&rsquo;s minds and passed out
of their conversation.</p>

<p>Months and years passed away, and nothing was known of the poor man.
His son, now come to the years of manhood, always declared that his father
would not have been absent from the trial willingly; and he firmly believed that
he had met with a violent death. More than this he would not say; but sometimes
when he looked towards Monsieur Baptiste Lacombe,&mdash;still the respected
organist of the church,&mdash;his eyes were observed to flash meaningly.</p>

<p>There was to be a grand <i>f&ecirc;te</i> in the church, and great preparation was made.
As the organ needed repairs, it was decided to repair it thoroughly; and one of
the builders from Bordeaux was sent for.</p>

<p>He was to come on Thursday; but he chanced to arrive the day before, and
was to begin work early the following morning. That night a light glimmered
out of the darkness of the gallery of the church.</p>

<p>Two days passed. The repairing of the organ went on; but there was much
to be done, and it might take a week. One afternoon, as Fran&ccedil;ois passed
through the centre of the village, two men came hurriedly out of the town-house,
and hastened away towards the church. It was the organ-builder, very much
excited, and one of the officials of the town. The young man, venturing on his
well-known skill as an organist, followed them; and the three entered the building.
A few worshippers were at the great altar, and the sacred edifice seemed
unusually quiet and peaceful.</p>

<p>The organ-builder seemed too agitated to answer the questions that the town
official asked him, but led the way quickly to the organ-loft. &ldquo;Put your foot on
that pedal!&rdquo; he said excitedly, pointing to a particular one of the scale.</p>

<p>The official was too bewildered to comply, and Fran&ccedil;ois did it for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now try the next one!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois did so, but no sound came; only a queer, intermittent rumbling,
like a bounding and rebounding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not sound,&rdquo; said the organ-builder. &ldquo;Follow me and I will show
you why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It never has sounded since the great trial-day, years ago,&rdquo; muttered the
young man. But he followed on.</p>

<p>They clambered up a rickety staircase, a still more rickety ladder, and came
to a platform at a level with the top of the organ; and all around them, reaching
up out of the dim light below, were the open pipes. Passing hurriedly around,
on a narrow plank, to the back of the organ, their agitated guide paused before
a row of immense pedal pipes, and, without allowing his own eyes to look, he
held the light that he carried for the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Both looked down into the cavernous tube that he indicated, and both started
back in surprise and fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a man&rsquo;s legs!&rdquo; gasped the frightened town official.</p>

<p>After the first moment of surprise had passed, they began to get back their
wits; and the young man advised that they send for several strong men and lift
out the pipe.</p>
</div>

<img src="images/zjnl047.jpg" width="500" height="370"
alt="Three men examine a locket" />
</div>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>This seemed sensible, and in a half-hour the men were at hand and the pipe
was drawn down to the level of the organ-loft and laid horizontally. The workmen
had been informed of the nature of their work, and all were under intense
excitement. The pipe was very long, and the body was at least five feet from
the top. One of the workmen reached in a pole having a hook at the end, and
the next minute drew forth the dead body of the sinister old organist, Baptiste
Lacombe.</p>

<p>There was a pause of silent horror. Nobody cared particularly for the dead
man, but the manner of his death was terrible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; whispered one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was suicide,&rdquo; answered another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
They began more closely to examine the huge tube. Fran&ccedil;ois Tegot, who,
although thus far cooler than the others, now seemed unable to stand, pointed
to the hand of the dead man, which was tightly clenched upon a small cord.
One of the workmen approached, and with some difficulty drew out the line:
and a new thrill of expectation went through the silent company when they saw,
attached to the end of the line, an old leather bundle covered with dust.</p>

<p>Young Tegot now seemed to master himself by a great effort, and, motioning
the workman back, he advanced, and, lifting the bag tenderly out into a more
convenient position, he said solemnly, as if to himself, &ldquo;I have long suspected
something was wrong, and now I shall know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he examined the bag, and at length took from his pocket a knife and
carefully cut open one side.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that he expected the revelation that now came, he started
back, for the opening revealed a piece of cloth,&mdash;a coat, which even the town
official could recollect to be the coat of the long-lost organist, Raoul Tegot,
Fran&ccedil;ois&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>The young man stepped back and sank again into his seat, and the others,
coming forward, laid the bag quite open, and drew forth a watch and an embroidered
vest; in a pocket of the coat was found a purse. &ldquo;Here is an odd
treasure,&rdquo; said one of the workmen, holding up a locket of dull gold.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois seized it and opened it. The color forsook his face and his eyes
filled with tears. He simply said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The town official now whispered to the surprised organ-builder, that the villanous
Lacombe had killed poor Tegot on the morning of the trial, and had
secreted the body in some unknown place and hidden the valuables here.
Frightened by the fear of discovery, he had attempted to remove the treasures,
had fallen into the pipe, and had thus met a horrible death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing secret,&rdquo; said Fran&ccedil;ois, &ldquo;but shall be revealed. Sin is its
own detector, and its secrets cannot rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The excitement among the townspeople was for many days even greater than
it had been at the time of Tegot&rsquo;s disappearance, and many and bitter were the
reproaches heaped upon the wicked organist&rsquo;s memory.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois was immediately chosen organist, and held the position during his
entire life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>EVENING THE FOURTH.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">Seven Nights on the Rhine:&mdash;Heidelberg.&mdash;Students.&mdash;Student Songs.&mdash;The
Story of Little Mook.&mdash;The Queer Old Lady who went to College.</p>


<p><span class="dcaph"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>EIDELBERG,&rdquo; said Mr. Beal, &ldquo;stands bright and
clear beside Neckar, a branch of the Rhine, as
though it loved the river. It is semicircled with
blue mountain-walls, and is full of balmy air and
cheerful faces. The streets have an atmosphere
of hospitality. Its history dates from the Roman
monuments on its hills, and is associated with the romantic times of
the counts-palatine of the Rhine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world-wide fame of Heidelberg arises from its university.
This was founded in 1386, and is the oldest in Germany. It made
Heidelberg a student-town; there art flourished and free thought
grew, and it became the gem of German cities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ancient Castle of Heidelberg is one of the wonders of Germany.
It is like a ruined town of palaces, and historic and poetic
associations are as thick as are the violets among its ruins. It is said
that Michael Angelo designed it: we cannot tell. The names of the
masters who upreared the pile of magnificence for centuries and peopled
it with statues are lost. The ivy creeps over their conceptions in
stone and marble, and the traveller exclaims in awe, &lsquo;Can it be that
all this glory was created for destruction?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">PALACE AT HEIDELBERG.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We visited the castle at noon. A ruin green with ivy rose before

us. The sunlight fell through the open doorways, and the swallows
flitted in and out of the window-frames into roofless chambers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was dreaming of the past: of the counts-palatine of the Rhine,
of stately dames, orange-gardens, and splendid festivals, when one of
the boys recalled my thoughts to the present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where is the tun?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What tun?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The one <em>we have come to see</em>,&mdash;the big wine-cask. It is said to
hold two hundred and thirty-six thousand bottles of wine, or did in the
days of the nobles.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I remember: when I was a boy my mental picture of Heidelberg
was a big wine-cask.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; well, please, sir, I am a boy now.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpadt">Mr. Beal then gave a brief account of</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">GERMAN STUDENT LIFE.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The town of Heidelberg nestles in one of the loveliest valleys in Europe.
The Neckar winds between a series of steep, high, thickly wooded hills.</p>

<p>It is amid such pleasant scenes that the famous university is situated, and
that several hundred German students are gathered to pursue their studies.</p>

<p>One of my chief objects in visiting Heidelberg was to see the university,
and to observe the curious student customs of which I had heard so much; and
my journey was amply repaid by what I saw.</p>

<p>The university itself was far less imposing than I had imagined; compared
with the picturesque and hoary old college palaces of Oxford and Cambridge, or
even with our own cosey Harvard and Yale edifices and greens, it seemed very
insignificant.</p>

<p>The buildings occupy a cheerless square in a central part of the quaint
old German town. They are very plain, modest, and unpretending. The
lecture-rooms are on one side of the square; in the rear are the museum and
reading room, while opposite the lecture-rooms is a row of jewelry, clothing,
confectionery, and other shops. I was most interested, however, in the students
and their ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
As soon as you enter the town and pass up the main street, you espy groups
of the students here and there. You are at once struck with the contrast they
present to American or English students. Very odd to American eyes are their
dress and manners. Let me describe one to you as an example.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE GERMAN STUDENT.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The Heidelberg student is a rather large, heavy-looking fellow, with round
face, broad shoulders, and a very awkward gait. His hair is cropped close to
his head, and on one side of the head, in jaunty fashion, he wears a small round
cap,&mdash;too small by far to cover it, as
caps generally do. It is of red or blue
or green, and worked with fanciful figures
of gold or silver thread.</p>

<p>On his feet are heavy boots, which
rise, outside his trousers, nearly to the
knees. His body is covered with a
gay frock-coat, of green or gray or
black. As he walks the street with
his college mates, he puffs away on a
very curious long pipe, the bowl being
of porcelain, on which is painted some
fanciful scene, or perhaps a view of the
grand old castle. Sometimes the stem
of the pipe is two or three feet long.
In his hand he carries a cane, or rather
stick (for it is too short to be used as
a cane), with some curiously carved
figure for a handle.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">GERMAN STUDENT.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Many of the Heidelberg students
are attended, wherever they go, by
a companion who is apt to produce
fear and dislike in those who
are not accustomed to him. This is a
small, blear-eyed, bullet-headed, bloodthirsty-looking
bull-dog, with red eyes
and snarling mouth. You see such dogs everywhere with the students, running
close to their heels, and ready, at an instant&rsquo;s notice, to defend their masters.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">CASTLE AT HEIDELBERG.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"><!-- blank page --></a></span></p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Almost every Heidelberg student belongs to one of the social societies, of
which some are called &ldquo;Verbindungs,&rdquo; and others &ldquo;Corps;&rdquo; and the caps they
wear designate the particular societies of which they are members.</p>

<p>These societies are both patriotic and social. The members devote themselves
to &ldquo;the glory of the Fatherland;&rdquo; and they pledge themselves by oaths
to defend and aid each other.</p>

<p>Besides the cap, the students betray to what society they belong by various
colored ribbons across their breasts or hung to their watch-chains. There is a
great deal of rivalry among the societies, which results in frequent difficulties.</p>

<p>The pastimes of the Heidelberg students are almost entirely confined to the
&ldquo;good times&rdquo; they have in their &ldquo;Verbindungs,&rdquo; in which they meet two nights in
the week to sing, make funny speeches, and perform certain curious ceremonies.</p>

<p>The students often make excursions to a beautiful spot on the Neckar, called
&ldquo;Wolfsbrunnen,&rdquo; where they obtain trout fresh from a pond, and eat them,
nicely cooked, on tables set out under the trees near the river-side.</p>

<p>Another frequent recreation is to attend the peasant fairs in the neighboring
villages, and to take jaunts to the lovely Swetzingen gardens, or to the top of the
Konigsthul hill, back of the castle, from which a most beautiful view of the Black
Forest and Hartz Mountains, with the broad valley of the Rhine, is to be seen.</p>

<p>On this hill is an inn where many resort to drink whey. Many of the students
are too poor to enjoy the pastimes of the others, or even to live at the
university without doing something to support themselves.</p>

<p>These go wandering about the country in vacation time, on foot, singing in
the villages, and receiving money from the kindly disposed, with which to pay
the expenses of their education. As you pass through Germany you frequently
meet parties of these poor students, who go about merrily; and to give them a
few kreuzers is always a pleasure.</p>

student songs. The first was</p>

<p class="caption">GERMAN STUDENTS.</p>


<p class="hrpadt">Mr. Beal, finding the Class interested, continued the subject by
some account of one of the most popular writers of German songs.</p>




<h4 class="smlpadt">HEINE.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The songs of Heine are unmatched in German literature, and have been
translated into all European tongues. Their beauty of expression, and suggestive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"><!-- illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and evasive meanings, have made them household words in Germany, and
favorite quotations in France and England.</p>

<p>The career of Heine was exceptionably brilliant, and he won tributes of
admiration that have seldom been equalled. It is said that on the appearance
of his &ldquo;Reisebilder&rdquo; in 1826-31, &ldquo;young Germany became intoxicated with
enthusiasm.&rdquo; His writings on republicanism not only won the heart of the
people, but carried his influence into other countries.</p>

<p>From his youth Heine was troubled by thoughts of personal religious responsibility.
There were periods when he earnestly sought to know man&rsquo;s true
relations to God. He sought the evidence of truth, however, more from nature,
philosophy, and history, than by the prayers and the faith which God&rsquo;s Word
inculcates.</p>

<p>He was born a Jew, but abandoned Judaism and was baptized in the
Lutheran Church. Then he became a free-thinker. He studied various philosophies
and systems of belief, but was not able to arrive at any satisfactory
conclusions.</p>

<p>In 1847 he was attacked by a strange disease. It paralyzed his body, and
confined him for many years to his chair. For seven years he was propped up
by pillows, and read his praises on a couch of suffering, and they made his life
more sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What good,&rdquo; he said, in despair, &ldquo;does it do me to hear that my health is
drunk in cups of gold, when I can only wet my lips with barley-water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this condition he read &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin.&rdquo; It revealed to him the
truth that religion is a matter of experience rather than philosophy, and
that the humblest may receive the evidence of its truth through simple faith
in Christ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my learning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the poor negro knew more about religion
than I do now, and I must come to a knowledge of the truth in the same humble
way as poor Uncle Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left this testimony in his will: &ldquo;I have cast aside all philosophical pride,
and have again felt the power of religious truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will recite to you one of the songs of Heine, which is popular among the
German students.</p>

<h4 class="smlpadt">LITTLE MOOK.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>There once lived a dwarf in the town of Niceu, whom the people called
Little Mook. He lived alone, and was thought to be rich. He had a very
small body and a very large head, and he wore an enormous turban.</p>

I will tell you his history.</p>

<p>His father was a hard-hearted man, and treated him unkindly because he
was deformed. The old man at last died, and his relatives drove the dwarf
away from his home.</p>

<p>He wandered into the strange world with a cheerful spirit, for the strange
world was more kind to him
than his kin had been.</p>

<p>He came at last to a strange
town, and looked around for
some face that should seem pitiful
and friendly. He saw an
old house, into whose door a
great number of cats were passing.
&ldquo;If the people here are so
good to cats, they may be kind
to me,&rdquo; he thought, and so he
followed them. He was met by
an old woman, who asked him
what he wanted.</p>

<p>He told his sad story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t cook any but for
my darling pussy cats,&rdquo; said the
beldame; &ldquo;but I pity your hard
lot, and you may make your
home with me until you can
find a better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Little Mook was employed
to look after the cats and
kittens.</p>

<p class="caption">LITTLE MOOK.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The kittens, I am sorry to say,
used to behave very badly when the old dame went abroad; and when she came
home and found the house in confusion, and bowls and vases broken, she used
to berate Little Mook for what he could not help.</p>

<p>While in the old lady&rsquo;s service he discovered a secret room in which were
magic articles, among them a pair of enormous slippers.</p>

<p>One day when the old lady was out the little dog broke a crystal vase.
Little Mook knew that he would be held responsible for the accident, and he
resolved to escape and try his fortune in the world again. He would need good
shoes, for the journey might be long; so he put on the big slippers and ran away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Ran? What wonderful slippers those were! He had only to say to them,
&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; and they would impel him forward with the rapidity of the wind. They
seemed to him like wings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will become a courier,&rdquo; said Little Mook, &ldquo;and so make my fortune, sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Little Mook went to the palace in order to apply to the king.</p>

<p>He first met the messenger-in-ordinary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you want to be the king&rsquo;s messenger,&mdash;you with your
little feet and great slippers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to make a trial of speed with your swiftest runner?&rdquo;
asked Little Mook.</p>

<p>The messenger-in-ordinary told the king about the little man and his application.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will have some fun with him,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Let him run a race
with my first messenger for the sport of the court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was arranged that Little Mook should try his speed with the swiftest
messenger.</p>

<p>Now the king&rsquo;s runner was a very tall man. His legs were very long and
slender; he had little flesh on his body. He walked with wonderful swiftness,
looking like a windmill as he strode forward. He was the telegraph of his
times, and the king was very proud of him.</p>

<p>The next day the king, who loved a jest, summoned his court to a meadow
to witness the race, and to see what the bumptious pygmy could do. Everybody
was on tiptoe of expectation, being sure that something amusing would
follow.</p>

<p>When Little Mook appeared he bowed to the spectators, who laughed at him.
When the signal was given for the two to start, Little Mook allowed the runner
to go ahead of him for a little time, but when the latter drew near the king&rsquo;s
seat he passed him, to the wonder of all the people, and easily won the race.</p>

<p>The king was delighted, the princess waved her veil, and the people all
shouted, &ldquo;Huzza for Little Mook!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Little Mook became the royal messenger, and surpassed all the runners
in the world with his magic slippers.</p>

<p>But Little Mook&rsquo;s great success with his magic slippers excited envy, and
made him bitter enemies, and at last the king himself came to believe the
stories of his enemies, and turned against him and banished him from his
kingdom.</p>

<p>Little Mook wandered away, sore at heart, and as friendless as when he had
left home and the house of the old woman. Just beyond the confines of the
kingdom he came to a grove of fig-trees full of fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
He stopped to rest and refresh himself with the fruit. There were two trees
that bore the finest figs he had ever seen. He gathered some figs from one of
them, but as he was eating them
his nose and ears began to
<em>grow</em>, and when he looked down
into a clear, pure stream near
by, he saw that his head had
been changed into a head like
a donkey.</p>

<p>He sat down under the
<em>other</em> fig-tree in despair. At
last he took up a fig that had
fallen from this tree, and ate it.
Immediately his nose and ears
became smaller and smaller
and resumed their natural
shape. Then he perceived that
the trees bore magic fruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy thought!&rdquo; said
Little Mook. &ldquo;I will go back
to the palace and sell the fruit
of the first tree to the royal
household, and then I will turn
doctor, and give the donkeys
the fruit of the second tree as
medicine. But I will not give
the old king any medicine.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Little Mook gathered the two kinds of figs, and returned to the palace and
sold that of the first tree to the butler.</p>

<p>Oh, then there was woe in the palace! The king&rsquo;s family were seen wandering
around with donkeys&rsquo; heads on their shoulders. Their noses and ears
were as long as their arms. The physicians were sent for and they held a <em>consultation</em>.
They decided on amputation; but as fast as they cut off the noses
and ears of the afflicted household, these troublesome members grew out again,
longer than before.</p>

<p>Then Little Mook appeared with the principles and remedies of hom&oelig;opathy.
He gave one by one of the sufferers the figs of the <em>second</em> tree, and they
were cured. He collected his fees, and having relieved all but the king he fled,
taking his hom&oelig;opathic arts with him. The king wore the head of a donkey
to his latest day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>FIFTH MEETING FOR RHINE STORIES.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">Seven Nights on the Rhine:&mdash;Worms.&mdash;Luther&rsquo;s Monument.&mdash;The Story of
Siegfried and the Dragon.&mdash;Mayence.&mdash;Boat Journey.&mdash;Stories of the
Castles on the Middle Rhine.&mdash;The Wonderful Story of the Lorelei.&mdash;Kerner.</p>


<p><span class="dcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>R. BEAL continued the narrative of travel at the
fifth meeting of the Club for the rehearsal of
Rhine stories.</p>


<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;We passed over a road along the right bank
of the Rhine towards Worms. We journeyed
amid green forests, and past fields which had heaped up harvests
for a thousand years. Spires gleamed on the opposite bank, and in
the flat landscape Worms came to view, the Rhine flowing calmly by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We stopped at Worms to see the cathedral and the Luther Monument.
It is a dull town. We recalled that it was here great C&aelig;sar
stood, and Attila drove his cavalry of devastation over the Rhine.
Here lived the hero of German classic song,&mdash;Siegfried. The cathedral
has a monumental history. In 772 war was declared in it against
the Saxons. Here was held the famous Diet of Worms at which
Luther appeared, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise. God help me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cathedral is of the style called Romanesque. It is lofty and
gloomy. Worms itself is a shadowy and silent city as compared with
the past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Luther Monument is a history of Protestantism in stone and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
bronze. It is one of the noblest works of art of modern times, and its
majesty and unity are a surprise to the traveller. Luther is of course
the central figure. He stands with his Bible in his hands, and his
face upturned to heaven. Around him are the figures of the great
reformers before the Reformation: Wycliffe, of England; Waldo, of
France; Huss, of Bohemia; and Savonarola, of Italy. The German
princes who befriended and sustained the Reformer occupy conspicuous
places, and the immense group presents a most impressive scene,
associated with lofty character and commanding talent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went to the place where Luther sat beneath a tree, when his

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would go to Worms,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;were there as many devils as
there are tiles upon the roofs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The high pitched roofs and innumerable tiles on them everywhere
met our eyes, and recalled the famous declaration.</p>

<h4 class="smlpadt">STORY OF SIEGFRIED AND THE NIBELUNG HEROES.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The early nations of Europe seem to have come out of the northwest of
Asia. The Celts or Gauls came first; other tribes followed them. These latter
tribes called themselves <i>Deutsch</i>, or <em>the people</em>. They settled between the Alps
and the Baltic Sea. In time they came to be called Ger-men, or war-men.
They lived in rude huts and held the lands in common. They were strong and
brave and prosperous.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A TRIBE OF GERMANS ON AN EXPEDITION.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>They worshipped the great god Woden. His day of worship was the fourth
of the week; hence Woden&rsquo;s-day, or Wednesday.</p>

<p>Woden was an all-wise god. Ravens carried to him the news from earth.
His temples were stone altars on desolate heaths, and human sacrifices were
offered to him.</p>

<p>Woden had a celestial hall called Valhall, and thither he transported the
souls of the brave; hence the name Valhalla.</p>

<p>There were supposed to be water gods in the rivers and elves throughout
the forest. The heavens were peopled with minor gods, as well as the great
gods, and the spirits of the unseen world could make themselves visible or invisible
to men as they chose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Most great nations have heroes of song sung by the poets, like those of
Homer and Virgil. The early German hero was Siegfried, and the song or
epic that celebrates his deeds is called the <i>Nibelungen Lied</i>. Its story is as
follows.</p>

<p>In the Land of Mist there was a lovely river, where dwelt little people who
could assume any form they wished. One of them was accustomed to change
himself into an otter when he went to the river to fish. As he was fishing one
day in this form he was caught by Loki, one of the great gods, who immediately
despatched him and took off his skin.</p>

<p>When his brothers Fafner and Reginn saw what had been done, they reproved
Loki severely, and demanded of him that he should fill the otter&rsquo;s skin
with gold, and give it to them as an atonement for his great misdeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I return the otter skin and give you the treasure you ask,&rdquo; said Loki;
&ldquo;but the gift shall bring you evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their father took the treasure, and Fafner murdered his father to secure it
to himself, and then turned into a dragon or serpent to guard it, and to keep his
brother from finding it.</p>

<p>Reginn had a wonderful pupil, named Siegfried, a Samson among the inhabitants
of the land. He was so strong that he could catch wild lions and hang
them by the tail over the walls of the castle. Reginn persuaded this pupil to
attack the serpent and to slay him.</p>

<p>Now Siegfried could understand the songs of birds; and the birds told him
that Reginn intended to kill him; so he slew Reginn and himself possessed the
treasure.</p>

<p>Serpents and dragons were called <em>worms</em> in Old Deutsch, and the Germans
called the town where Siegfried lived Worms.</p>

<p>Siegfried had bathed himself in the dragon&rsquo;s blood, and the bath made his
skin so hard that nothing could hurt him except in one spot. A leaf had fallen
on this spot as he was bathing. It was between his shoulders.</p>

<p>Siegfried, like Samson, had a curious wife. His romances growing out of his
love for this woman would fill a volume. She had learned where his one vulnerable
spot lay. But she was a lovely lady, and the wedded pair lived very happily
together at Worms.</p>

<p>At last a dispute arose between them and their relatives, and the latter
sought to destroy Siegfried&rsquo;s life. His wife went for counsel to a supposed
friend, but real enemy, named Hagen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your husband is invulnerable,&rdquo; said Hagen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, except in one spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
&ldquo;And you know the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sew a patch on his garment over it, and I shall know how to protect
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor wife had revealed a fatal secret. She sewed a patch on her husband&rsquo;s
garment between the shoulders, and now thought him doubly secure.</p>

<p class="caption">THE MURDER OF SIEGFRIED.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>There was to be a great hunting-match, and Siegfried entered into it as a
champion. He rode forth in high spirits, but on his back was the fatal patch.</p>

<p>Hagen contrived that the wine should be left behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will compel the hunters to lie down on their breasts to
drink from the streams when they become thirsty. Then will come my opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was right in his conjecture.</p>

<p>Siegfried became tired and thirsty. He rode up to a stream. He threw
himself on his breast to drink, exposing his back, on which was the patch, revealing
the vulnerable place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
There he was stabbed by a conspirator employed by Hagen.</p>

<p>They bore the dead body of the hero down the Rhine, and lamented the departed
champion as the barque drifted on. The scene has been portrayed in art
and song, and has left its impress on the poetic associations of the river. You
will have occasion to recall this story again in connection with Drachenfels.</p>
</div>


<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;Our fifth night on the Rhine was passed at Mayence, at the H&ocirc;tel
de Hollande, near the landing-place of the Rhine steamers. The
balconies and windows of the hotel afforded fine views of the river
and of the Taunus Mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayence is said to have arisen by magic. The sorcerer Nequam
wished for a new city; he came to this point of the Rhine, spoke the
word, and the city rose. It is almost as old as the Christian era.
Here the Twenty-second Roman legion came, after its return from
the conquest of Jerusalem, and brought Christianity with it, through
some of its early converts. It was one of the grand cities of Charlemagne,
who erected a palace at Lower Ingelheim, and introduced the
cultivation of the vine. Here lived Bishop Hatto, of bad repute, and
good Bishop Williges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here rose Gutenberg, the inventor of printing, and here Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s
statue of the great inventor announces to the traveller what
a great light of civilization appeared to the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Mayence we began the most delightful zigzag we had ever
made,&mdash;a boat journey on the Rhine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you would see the Rhine of castles and vineyards.&rsquo; said an
English friend, &lsquo;hire a boat. The most famous river scenery in the
world lies between Mayence and Cologne. If you take the railroad
you will merely <em>escape</em> it in a few hours; if a steamboat, your curiosity
will be excited, but not gratified; it will all vanish like a dream: take
a boat, my good American friend,&mdash;take a boat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between Mayence and Bingen the Rhine attains its greatest
breadth. It is studded with a hundred islands. Its banks are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
continuous vineyards. Here is the famous district called the Rheingau,
which extends along the right bank of the river, where the Rhine
wines are produced.</p>

<p class="caption">MAYENCE.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is all a luxurious wine-garden,&mdash;the Rheingau. The grapes
purple beside ruins and convents, as well as on their low artificial
trellises, and everywhere drink in the sunshine and grow luscious in
the mellow air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Castles, palaces, ruins, towers, and quaint towns all mingle with
the vineyards. A dreamy light hangs over the scene; the river is
calm, and the boat drifts along in an atmosphere in which the spirit
of romance seems to brood, as though indeed the world&rsquo;s fairy tales
were true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came in sight of Bingen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We must stop there,&rsquo; said Willie Clifton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; I asked curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because&mdash;well&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For I was born at Bingen,&mdash;at Bingen on the Rhine.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;He then repeated slowly and in a deep, tender voice the beginning
of a poem that almost every schoolboy knows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was lack of woman&rsquo;s nursing, there was dearth of woman&rsquo;s tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a comrade stood beside him, while his life-blood ebbed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade&rsquo;s hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said, &ldquo;I nevermore shall see my own, my native land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take a message and a token to some distant friends of mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I was born at Bingen,&mdash;at Bingen on the Rhine.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Bingen is a town of about seven thousand inhabitants, and is engaged
in the wine trade. We visited the chapel of St. Rochus, on a
hill near the town, because one of our party had somewhere read that
Bulwer had said that the view from St. Rochus was the finest in the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again upon the river, all the banks seemed filled with castles,
villages, and ruins. Every hill had its castle, every crag its gray tower.
We drifted by the famous Mouse Tower, which stands at the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
an island meadow fringed with osier twigs. It is little better than a
square tower of a common village church,
nor is there any truth in the story that
Southey&rsquo;s poem has associated with it.
Poor Bishop Hatto, of evil name and
memory! He died in 970, and the tower
was not built until the thirteenth century.
For aught that is known, he
was a good man; he certainly was
not eaten up by rats or mice. The legend
runs:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;In the tenth century Hatto, Bishop
of Fulda, was raised to the dignity of Archbishop
of Mayence. He built a strong tower on
the Rhine, wherein to collect tolls from the vessels
that passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A famine came to the Rhine countries. Hatto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
had vast granaries, and the people came to him for bread. He refused
them, and they importuned him. He bade them go into a large granary,
one day, promising them relief. When they had entered the
building, he barred the doors and set it on fire, and the famishing
beggars, among whom were many women and children, were consumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bishop listened to the cries of the dying for mercy as the
building was burning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;hear the rats squeak.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the building fell millions of rats ran from the ruins to the
bishop&rsquo;s palace. They filled all the rooms and attacked the people.
The bishop was struck with terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We passed ruin after ruin which the boatman said were &lsquo;robber
castles.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what do you mean by <em>robber</em> castles?&rsquo; asked Herman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The old lords of the Rhine used to collect tolls from the vessels
that passed their estates. The tax was regarded as unjust, and hence
the lords were themselves called robbers, and their castles robber
castles.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of these castles, called the <i>Pfalzgrafenstein</i>, is said to resemble
a stone ship at anchor in the river. It was formerly a rock, with one
little hut upon it, and it was associated with a touching incident of
history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Louis le Debonnaire, the son of Charlemagne, became weary of
state-craft and the crown. He felt that his end was near. He desired
to die where he could hear the waves of the Rhine. He was taken to
this rock, and there with the ebb of the river his troubled life ebbed
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
&ldquo;Most of the old castles are built on the narrows of the river. These
narrows are between high rocks and rocky hills. They are in the
Middle Rhine, or between Mayence and Bonn. The Middle Rhine
has some thirty conspicuous castles on its banks. It is sometimes
called the Castellated Rhine, and its narrows are termed the Castellated
Rhine Pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On, on we drifted. Every high rock seemed a gateway to some
new scene of beauty; wonder followed wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now the water seemed agitated. Dark rocks projected into
the river; the view was intercepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boatman conversed in an animated way with me, and I looked
up to a high rock with an interested expression and an incredulous
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He turned to us quietly and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the Lorelei Pass.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He presently added,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is the Lorelei.&rsquo;</p>

<h4 class="smlpadt">THE WONDERFUL STORY OF THE LORELEI.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Who has not heard it, repeated it in verse, echoed it in song?</p>

<p>It is the best known of the Rhine tales, not because it is the most interesting,
but because it is associated with the noblest scenery of the river, with
poetry and music. It is hardly equal to such legends as the &ldquo;Drachenfels&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Two Brothers,&rdquo; but it is lifted into historic prominence by its
associations.</p>

<p>Still the story is richer in incident than the mere song would indicate. The
origin and development of the popular legend is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the shadowy days of the Palatines of the Rhine,&mdash;shadowy because of
ignorance and superstition,&mdash;the boatmen among the rocks above St. Goar on
the Rhine used to fancy that they could see at night the form of a beautiful
nymph on the &ldquo;Lei,&rdquo; or high rock of the river. Her limbs were moulded of
air; a veil of mist and gems covered her face; her hair was long and golden,
and her eyes shone like the stars. Her robe was blue and glimmering like
the waves, decked with water flowers and zoned with crystals. She was most
distinctly seen by pale moonlight.</p>

<p>They called this recurring vision of mist and gems Lore, the enchantress.
They believed that her favor brought good luck, but her ill will destruction.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more natural than for the simple fishermen to think that
they saw a form of mist, very bright and lovely, above the rocks at night, when
once the story had been told them.</p>

<p>In the days of superstition such a story was sure to grow.</p>

<p>It was said that this Undine of the Rhine, the enchantress Lore, had a most
melodious and seductive voice. When she sang those who heard her listened
spellbound. If the boatmen displeased her, she entranced them by her song,
and drew them into the whirlpools under the rocks, where they disappeared forever.
To the landsmen who offended her, she made the river appear like a road,
and led them to fall over the rocks to destruction. With all her beauty and
charms, she was the evil genius of the place.</p>

<p>Herman, the only son of the last Palatine, a youth of some fifteen summers,
was delicate in health. Instead of devoting himself to chivalrous exercises, he
gave his attention to music and song.</p>

<p>One night he and his father were descending the Rhine, when he felt an
inspiration come over him to sing. His voice was silvery and flute-like, and
breathed the emotional sentiment of the heart of youth. As the boat drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
near the Lei, Lore, the enchantress, heard the song, and she herself became
spellbound by the sentiment and deep feeling expressed in the mellifluent
music.</p>

<p>She tried to answer him, but her voice failed.</p>

<p>As Herman grew to manhood his ill health disappeared, and his character
changed. He became rugged and manly, and abandoned the arts for the chase,
horsemanship, and the preparations for martial contests.</p>

<p>He became a renowned hunter. He rode the wildest steeds, and ventured
into places and merrily blew his horn where no huntsman dared follow him.</p>

<p>The enchantress Lore, from the time she had heard his song, disappeared
from the rocks. The change that came over his person and character seemed
like enchantment: was the siren invisibly following him?</p>

<p>And now a strange thing began to startle him by its mystery. When alone,
crossing a wild mountain or a ravine, he would seek to keep up a communication
by shouting through his hands,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hillo-ho-o-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately a sweet voice would answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho-o-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would follow the sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hillo-ho-o-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho-o-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It always led him towards the Lei.</p>

<p>He became alarmed at this occurrence. He believed that he was followed
by a spirit, and that a spell was upon him, which boded destruction. He
resolved to abandon the chase and devote himself to the arts again.</p>

<p>He was sitting by the window of the castle on a summer evening. A purple
mist lay on the forests and river, and the moon poured her light over it,
making all things appear like an enchanted realm.</p>

<p>He heard a nightingale singing in the woods. Did ever a bird sing like
that? He listened. There was a witchery in the song. He rose and went
into the woods. The song filled the air like a shower of golden notes. He
followed it. It retreated. He went on. But the song, more and more enchanting
and alluring, floated into the shadowy distance. He found himself at last
on the Lei.</p>

<p>He beheld there a dazzling grotto, full of stalactites, and a nymph of wondrous
beauty on a coral throne. He felt his being thrill with love. He was
about to enter the grotto, when, oh thought of darkness and horror! the
recollection of the enchantress came to him, and he crossed his bosom and
broke the spell. He hurried home with a beating heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
But the temptation and vision had proved fatal to
him. He was never himself again. He dreamed
constantly of Lore. All his longings were for her.</p>

<p>At eve he would hear the same nightingale
singing. He would long to follow the voice. It
inflamed his love. His will, his senses, all that
made life desirable, were yielding to the fatal passion.</p>

<p>He went to a good priest for advice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father Walter, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shake off the spell, or it will end in
your ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day Herman and the priest
went fishing on the Rhine. The
boat drifted near the Lei. The
moon rose in full splendor in the clear sky, strewing
the water with countless gems.</p>

<p>Herman took a lute and filled the air with music.</p>

<p>It was answered from the Lei. Oh, how wonderful!
The air seemed entranced with the spiritual
melody. Herman was beside himself
with delight. The priest also heard it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lore! In the name of the
Virgin, let us make for the shore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The priest plied the
oar, to turn the boat
back.</p>

<p>But nearer, nearer
drifted the boat to the
rock.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer!</p>

<p>The moon poured
her white light upon the
crags.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer!</p>

<p>There was a shock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
The boat was shivered like glass.</p>

<p>Walter crossed himself, and floated on the waves to the shore.</p>

<p>But Herman&mdash;he was never seen again!</p>

<p class="hrpadt">Mr. Beal&rsquo;s narrative nearly filled the evening. A few stories
were told by other members of the Club, but they were chiefly
from Grimm, and hence are somewhat familiar.</p>

<p>Charlie Leland closed the meeting with a free translation of a
poem from Kerner.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p class="hrpadt">Justinus Kerner was born in Ludwigsburg, in 1786. He was a physician
and a poet. He belonged to the spiritualistic school of poets, and his illustrations
of the power of mind over matter, in both prose and poetry, are often
very forcible. The following poem will give you a view of his estimate of
physical as compared with mental power:&mdash;</p>

Strange Story of Faust.&mdash;Faust in Art.&mdash;The Seven Mountains.&mdash;The

<p><span class="dcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>R. BEAL occupied much of the time this evening.
He thus continued the narrative of travel:&mdash;</p>


<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;From St. Goar to Boppard, two stations at
which the Rhine boats call, is about an hour&rsquo;s
run; but the journey is an unfailing memory.
The rocky walls of the river, the continuous villages, the quaint
churches amid the vineyards and cherry orchards, the mossy meadows
about the mountains, the white-kerchiefed villagers, present so many
varied and delightful objects, that the eye feasts on beauty, and wonders
expectantly at what the next turn of the river will reveal. The
rock shadows in the water contrast with the bright scenes above the
river, and add an impression of grandeur to the effect of the whole,
like shadows on the cathedral walls that heighten the effect of the
rose-colored windows. Beautiful, beautiful, is the Rhine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grand castles, perched on high cliffs and mountain walls, surprise
us, delight us, and vanish behind us, as the boat moves on;&mdash;the
Brother Castles, Marksburg, the mountain palace Solzenfels, with
their lofty, gloomy, and barbaric grandeur, reminding one always of
times whose loss the mind does not regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now a beautiful city comes in view, nestled at the foot of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hills, and protected by a stupendous fortress on the opposite side of
the river. The fortress is Ehrenbreitstein, the Gibraltar of the Rhine,
capable of holding an army of men. It is a great arsenal now, well
garrisoned in peace as in war; in short, it may be called the watch
on the Rhine.</p>

<p class="caption">EHRENBREITSTEIN.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lovely city under its guns, on the opposite side of the river,
is Coblentz. It is a gusset of houses, a V-shaped city, at the confluence
of the Rhine and Moselle. The Romans called it the city
of the Confluence, or Confluentia; hence, corrupted, it is known as
Coblentz.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
resting place of tourists. The summer residence of the King of
Germany is here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Coblentz we made a d&eacute;tour into the heart of Germany,
going by rail to Weimar, once called the Athens of the North. It
was once the literary centre of Germany. Here lived Goethe, Schiller,
Wieland, and Herder. What the English Lake District, in the
days of Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, Christopher North, and
De Quincey was once to England, what Cambridge and Concord
have been to America in the best days of its authors and poets,
Weimar was to Germany at the beginning of the present century.
We went there to visit the tombs and statues of Goethe, and
to gain a better knowledge of the works of these poets from the
associations of their composition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weimar is a quaint provincial-looking town on the river Ilm. It
has some sixteen thousand inhabitants, and is the residence of the
Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar. The grounds of the palace are wonderfully
beautiful. They extend along the river, and communicate
with a summer palace called Belvedere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We visited the tombs of the two great poets. They are found
beneath a small chapel in the Grand Ducal burial vault. The Grand
Duke Charles Augustus desired that the bodies of the two poets
should be interred one on each side of him: but this was forbidden
by the usages of the court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the old Stadtkirche, built in 1400, are the tombs of the ancient
dukes, now forgotten. Among them is that of Duke Bernard, who
died in 1639. He was the friend of Gustavus Adolphus, and one of
the most powerful of the leaders of the Reformation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goethe, the most gifted of the German poets, and the most accomplished
man of his age, was born at Frankfort-on-the-Main, in 1749.
In 1775 he made the intimate acquaintance of Charles Augustus,
Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, who induced him to take up his residence
at Weimar, the capital. Here he held many public offices, and
at last became minister of state. He died at the age of eighty-four.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
&ldquo;Goethe&rsquo;s most popular work is a novel called <i>The Sorrows of
Werther</i>, but his great and enduring work is <i>Faust</i>, a dramatic poem,
in which his great genius struggles with the problems of good and evil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His life was full of beautiful friendships. In 1787 Schiller, the
second in rank of great German poets, was invited to reside at Weimar.
Goethe became most warmly attached to him, and the two
pursued their high literary callings together. The literary circle now
consisted of Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, Herder, and the Grand Duke.
It was the golden age of German literature.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE STRANGE STORY OF FAUST.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>No myth of the Middle Ages has had so large a growth and so long a life
as this.</p>

<p>It has been made the subject of books, pamphlets, and articles almost without
number. The Faust literature in Germany would fill a library.</p>

<p>In painting, especially of the Holland school, the dark subject as prominently
appears. It is also embodied in sculpture.</p>

<p>But it is in poetry and music that it found a place that carried it over the
world. It was made the subject of Marlowe&rsquo;s drama, of Goethe&rsquo;s greatest poem,
and it is sung in three of the greatest operas of modern times.</p>

<p>But to the legend.</p>

<p>About the year 1490 there was born at Roda, in the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar,
a child whose fame was destined to fill the world of superstition, fable,
and song. He was named John Faustus, or Faust.</p>

<p>He studied medicine, became an alchemist, and was possessed with a consuming
desire to learn the secrets of life and of the spiritual world.</p>

<p>He studied magic, and his thirst for knowledge of the occult sciences grew.
He wished to know how to prolong life, to change base metals to gold, to do
things at once by the power of the will.</p>

<p>One night, as he was studying, the Evil One appeared before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will reveal to you all the secrets you are seeking, and will enable you to
do anything you wish by the power of the will alone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus was filled with an almost insane delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;On one condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
&ldquo;That I shall have your soul in return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the end of twenty-four years&mdash;at this time of night&mdash;midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have pleasure?&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;I will sign the compact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sign!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faust signed his name to a compact that was to give the Evil One his soul
for twenty-four years of pleasure, gold, and
knowledge, that were to come to an end at
midnight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you an attendant,&rdquo; said
the Evil One, &ldquo;to help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He caused a dark but very elegant
gentleman to appear, whom he presented
to Faust as Mephistopheles.</p>

<p>Dr. Faustus and Mephistopheles
now began
to travel into all lands, performing
wonders to the
amazement of all people
wherever they went.</p>

<p>In a wine-cellar at
Leipsig, where he and Mephistopheles
were drinking,
some gay fellows said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faust,
make grapes
grow on a vine on this
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was dead silence.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>A vine began to grow
from the table, and presently
it bore a bunch of grapes for each of the revellers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your knives and cut a cluster for each.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
There was an explosion. Faust and Mephistopheles were seen flying out
of the window; the <em>window</em> is still shown in Leipsig. The vine had disappeared,
and each of the revellers found himself with his knife over his nose,
about to cut it off, supposing it to be a cluster of grapes.</p>

<p>The wonders that it is claimed that Dr. Faustus did in the twenty-four
years fill volumes. The Faust marvels have gathered to themselves the fables
of centuries.</p>

<p>The twenty-four years came to an end at last. Faust became gloomy, and
retired to Rimlich, at the inn, among his old friends.</p>

<p>The fatal night came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you hear noises in my chamber to-night, do not disturb me,&rdquo; he
said, on parting from his companions to go to his room.</p>

<p>Near midnight a tempest arose,&mdash;a wild, strange tempest. The winds were
like demons. It thundered and the air was full of tongues of lightning.</p>

<p>At midnight there was heard a fearful shriek in Faust&rsquo;s chamber.</p>

<p>The next morning the room was found bespattered with blood, and the
body of Faust was missing. The broken remains of the alchemist were discovered
at last in a back yard on a heap of earth.</p>

<p>This was the village story. It grew as such a dark myth would grow in
the superstitious times in which it started. Goethe created the character of
Marguerite and added it to the fable. The transformation of Faust from
extreme old age to youth was also added. The opera makers have greatly
enlarged even the narrative of Goethe; in the latest evolution, Mephistopheles
is summoned into the courts of heaven and sent forth to tempt Faust, and
Faust is shown visions of the Greek vale of Tempe and Helen of Troy.</p>

<p>Faust has come to be a synonym of the great problem of Good and Evil;
the contest between virtue and vice, temptation and ruin, temptation and
moral triumph. It is not a good story in any of its evolutions, but it is one
that to know is almost essential to intelligence.</p>

<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;Returning to Coblentz, we passed our sixth night on the Rhine.
We there hired a boatman to take us to Bonn. Between Coblentz
and Andernach we passed what are termed the Rhine Plains. These
are some ten miles long, and are semicircled by volcanic mountains,
whose fires have long been dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We now approached the Seven Mountains, among which is the
Drachenfels, famous in fable and song. These are called: Lohrberg,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
1,355 feet; Neiderstromberg, 1,066 feet; Oelberg, 1,429 feet; Wolkenberg,
1,001 feet; Drachenfels, 1,056 feet; Petenberg, 1,030 feet; Lowenberg,
1,414 feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Drachenfels is made picturesque by an ancient ruin, and it
is these ancient ruins, and associations of old history, that make the
Rhine the most interesting river in the world. Apart from its castles
and traditions, it is not more beautiful than the Hudson, the Upper
Ohio, or the Mississippi between St. Paul and Winona. But the
Rhine displays the ruined arts of two thousand years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Drachenfels has its wonderful story. It is said that Siegfried
killed the Dragon there. The so-called Dragon Cave or Rock
is there, and of this particular dragon many curious tales are told.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the early days of Christianity the cross was regarded as something
more than a mere emblem of faith. It was believed to possess
miracle-working power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a rocky cavern of the Drachenfels, in ancient times, there lived
a Dragon of most hideous form. He had a hundred teeth, and his
head was so large that he could swallow several victims at a time.
His body was of enormous length, and in form like an alligator&rsquo;s, and
he had a tail like a serpent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pagans of the Rhine worshipped this monster and offered to
him human sacrifices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In one of the old wars between rival princes, a Christian girl was
taken captive, and the pagan priest commanded that she should be
made an offering to the Dragon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the custom of the pagans to bind their sacrifices to the
Dragon alive to a tree near his cave at night. At sunrise he would
come out and devour them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They led the lovely Christian maiden to a spot near the cave, and
bound her to a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was starlight. Priests and warriors with torches had conducted
the maiden to the fatal spot, and stood at a little distance from the
victim, waiting for the sunrise.</p>

&ldquo;The priests chanted their wild hymns, and the light at last began
to break and to crown the mountains and be scattered over the blue
river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The roar of the monster was heard. The rocks trembled, and he
appeared. He approached the maiden, bound to an oak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her eyes were raised in prayer towards heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the Dragon approached the victim, she drew from her bosom
a crucifix, and held it up before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as he saw it, he began to tremble. He fell to the earth
as if smitten. He lost all power and rolled down the rocks, a shapeless
mass, into the Rhine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pagans released the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By what power have you done this?&rsquo; they asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By this,&rsquo; said the maiden, stretching out the cross in her hand.
&lsquo;I am a Christian.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then we will become Christians,&rsquo; said the pagans, and they led
the lovely apostle away to be their teacher. Her first convert was one
of the rival princes, whom she married. Their descendants were
among the most eminent of the early Christian families of the Seven
Mountains of the Rhine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such is the fable as told by the monks of old. The figure of the
power of the cross over the serpent, employed in early Christian writings,
undoubtedly was its origin, but how it became associated with
the story of the captive maiden it would be hard to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="smlpadt">FREDERICK THE GREAT.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, was born in 1712. He was a wilful
youth, and his father subjected him to such severe discipline that he revolted
against it, and, like other boys not of royal blood, formed a plan of running away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
from home. His father discovered the plot, and caused his son&rsquo;s most intimate
friend, who had assisted him in it, to be put to death, and made the execution
as terrible as possible. He early came to hate his father, his father&rsquo;s religion,
and everything that the old king most liked. His father was indeed a hard,
stern man, of colorless character; but he managed the affairs of state so prudently
that he left his undutiful son a powerful army and a full treasury, and to
these as much as to any noble qualities of mind or soul the latter owed the resources
by which he gained the title <span class="smcap">The Great</span>.</p>

<p>His mother was a daughter of George I. Frederick loved her, and from her he
inherited a taste for music and literature, like many of the family of the Georges.
He formed an intimate friendship with Voltaire, the French infidel writer, and
interested himself in the French infidelity of the period, which was a reaction
against the corrupt and degenerate French church.</p>

<p>He entered the field as a soldier in 1741, and was victorious again and again
in the two Silesian wars. The Seven Years&rsquo; War, begun in 1756, gained for him
a position of great influence among the rulers of Europe. He was prudent, like
his father; his government was wise, well ordered, and liberal, and he left to his
successor a full treasury, a great and famous army, enlarged territory, and the
prestige of a great name.</p>

<p>The family affairs of kings during the last century were in rather a queer
state, as the following story of Frederick&rsquo;s marriage will show.</p>

<p>The prince was told that his father was studying the characters of the young
ladies of the courts of Europe in order to select a suitable wife for him. He
admired talent, brilliancy, wit, and he said in substance to the Minister of
State,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Influence my father if you can to obtain for me a gifted and elegant princess.
Of all things in the world I would hate to have a dull and commonplace
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His father made choice of the Princess Elizabeth Christine of Brunswick, a
girl famous for her awkwardness and stupidity.</p>

<p>The prince did everything in his power to prevent the marriage. But the
old king declared that he should marry her, and the wedding ceremony was
arranged, Frederick in the mean time protesting that he held the bride in utter
detestation.</p>

<p>Frederick had a sister whom he dearly loved, Wilhelmina. Two days after
his marriage, he introduced the bride to her, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a sister whom I adore. She has had the goodness to promise that
<em>she</em> will take care of you and give you good advice. I wish you to do nothing
without her consent. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

The young bride, scarcely eighteen, was speechless. She expected &ldquo;care&rdquo;
and &ldquo;advice&rdquo; from her husband, and not from his sister.</p>

<p>Wilhelmina embraced her tenderly.</p>

<p>Frederick waited for an answer to his question. But she stood dumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plague take the <em>blockhead</em>!&rdquo; he at last exclaimed, and with this compliment
began the long and sorrowful story of her wedded life.</p>

<p>She was a good woman and bore her husband&rsquo;s neglect with patience.
Strangely enough, in his old age Frederick came to love her; for he discovered,
after a prejudice of years, that she had a noble soul.</p>

<p>Frederick died in 1786. In his will he made a most liberal allowance for his
wife, and bore testimony to her excellent character, saying that she never had
caused him the least discontent, and her incorruptible virtue was worthy of love
and consideration.</p>

<p>She survived the king eleven years.</p>

<h4 class="smlpadt">THE UNNERVED HUSSAR.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>A man once entered the vaults of a church by night, to rob a corpse of a
valuable ring. In replacing the lid he nailed the tail of his coat to the coffin,
and when he started up to leave, the coffin clung to him and moved towards
him.</p>

<p>Supposing the movement to be the work of invisible hands, his nervous
system received such a shock that he fell in a fit, and was found where he fell,
by the sexton, on the following morning.</p>

<p>Now, had the fellow been honestly engaged, it is not likely that the blunder
would have happened; and even had it occurred, he doubtless would have discovered
at once the cause.</p>

<p>But very worthy people are sometimes affected by superstitious fear, and run
counter to the dictates of good sense and sound judgment.</p>

<p>A magnificent banquet was once given by a lord, in a very ancient castle, on
the confines of Germany. Among the guests was an officer of hussars, distinguished
for great self-possession and bravery.</p>

<p>Many of the guests were to remain in the castle during the night; and the
gallant hussar was informed that one of them must occupy a room reputed to be
haunted, and was asked if he had any objections to accepting the room for
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
He declared that he had none whatever, and thanked his host for the honor
conferred upon him by the offer. He, however, expressed a wish that no trick
might be played upon him, saying that such an act might be followed by very
serious consequences, as he should use his pistols against whatever disturbed
the peace of the room.</p>

<p>He retired after midnight, leaving his lamp burning; and, wearied by the
festivities, soon fell asleep. He was presently awakened by the sound of music,
and, looking about the apartment, saw at the opposite end, three phantom ladies,
grotesquely attired, singing a mournful dirge.</p>

<p>The music was artistic, rich, and soothing, and the hussar listened for a time,
highly entertained. The piece was one of unvarying
sadness, and, however seductive at first, after a time
lost its charm.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE UNNERVED HUSSAR.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The officer, addressing the musical damsels, remarked that the music had
become rather monotonous, and asked them to change the tune. The singing
continued in the same mournful cadences. He became impatient, and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies, this is an impertinent trick, for the purpose of frightening me. I
shall take rough means to stop it, if it gives me any further trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
He seized his pistols in a manner that indicated his purpose. But the mysterious
ladies remained, and the requiem went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;I will wait five minutes, and then shall fire, unless
you leave the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The figures remained, and the music continued. At the expiration of the
time, the officer counted twenty in a loud, measured voice, and then, taking
deliberate aim, discharged both of his pistols.</p>

<p>The ladies were unharmed, and the music was uninterrupted. The unexpected
result of his violence threw him into a state of high nervous excitement,
and, although his courage had withstood the shock of battle, it now yielded to
his superstitious fears. His strength was prostrated, and a severe illness of some
weeks&rsquo; continuance followed.</p>

<p>Had the hussar held stoutly to his own sensible philosophy, that he had no
occasion to fear the spirits of the invisible world, nothing serious would have
ensued. The damsels sung in another apartment, and their figures were made
to appear in the room occupied by the hussar, by the effect of a mirror. The
whole was a trick, carefully planned, to test the effect of superstitious fear on
one of the bravest of men.</p>

<p>In no case should a person be alarmed at what he suspects to be supernatural.
A cool investigation will show, in most cases, that the supposed
phenomenon may be easily explained. It might prove a serious thing for one to
be frightened by a nightcap on a bedpost, for a fright affects unfavorably the
nervous system, but a nightcap on a bedpost is in itself a very harmless thing.</p>

The long bridge of boats opens; a steamer passes, followed by a crowd
of boats; it closes, and the waiting crowd upon it hurry over. The
Rhine at night here presents a most animated scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The river seems alive, but the city looks dead. There is a faded
glory on everything. There are steeples and steeples, towers and
towers. Cologne is said to have had at one time as many churches as
there are days in the year. But life has gone out of them; they are
like deserted houses. They belonged to the religious period of evolution,
and are like geologic formations now,&mdash;history that has had its
day, and left its tombstone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cologne is as old as Rome in her glory,&mdash;older than the Christian
era. She was the second great city of the Church in the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cologne is full of wonders in stone and marble, wonders in
legend and story as well; and among these the cathedral holds the
first place, in both art and fable.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE MYSTERIOUS ARCHITECT.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>In the thirteenth century&mdash;so the story goes&mdash;Archbishop Conrad determined
to erect a cathedral that should surpass any Christian temple in the
world.</p>

<p>Who should be the architect?</p>

<p>He must be a man of great genius, and his name would become immortal.</p>

<p>There <em>was</em> a wonderful builder in Cologne, and the Archbishop went to him
with his purpose, and asked him to attempt the design.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must not only surpass anything in the past, but anything that may arise
in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The architect was awed in view of such a stupendous undertaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will carry my name down the ages,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I will sacrifice everything
to success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dreamed; he fasted and prayed.</p>

<p>He made sketch after sketch and plan after plan, but they all proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
unworthy of a temple that should be one of the grandest monuments of the piety
of the time, and one of the glories of future ages.</p>

<p>In his dreams an exquisite image of a temple rose dimly before him. When
he awoke, he could vaguely recall it, but could not reproduce it. The ideal
haunted him and yet eluded him.</p>

<p>He became disheartened. He wandered in the fields, absorbed in thought.
The beautiful apparition of the temple would suddenly fill him with delight;
then it would vanish, as if it were a mockery.</p>

<p>One day he was wandering along the Rhine, absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the phantom temple would appear to me, and linger
but for a moment, that I could grasp the design.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down on the shore, and began to draw a plan with a stick on the
sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is it,&rdquo; he cried with joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is it, indeed,&rdquo; said a mocking voice behind him.</p>

<p>He looked around, and beheld an old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is it,&rdquo; the stranger hissed; &ldquo;that is the Cathedral of Strasburg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was shocked. He effaced the design on the sand.</p>

<p>He began again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; he again exclaimed with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chuckled the old man. &ldquo;That is the Cathedral of Amiens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The architect effaced the picture on the sand, and produced another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Metz,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>

<p>He made yet another effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Antwerp!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my master,&rdquo; said the despairing architect, &ldquo;you mock me. Produce a
design for me yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On one condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall give me yourself, soul and body!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The affrighted architect began to say his prayers, and the old man suddenly
disappeared.</p>

<p>The next day he wandered into a forest of the Seven Mountains, still thinking
of his plan. He chanced to look up the mountain side, when he beheld the queer
old man again; he was now leaning on a staff on a rocky wall.</p>

<p>He lifted his staff and began to draw a picture on a rock behind him. The
lines were of fire.</p>

<p>Oh, how beautiful, how grand, how glorious, it all was!</p>

Fretwork, spandrels, and steeples. It <em>was</em>&mdash;it <em>was</em> the very design that
had haunted the poor architect, that flitted across his mind in dreams but left
no memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you have my plan?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do all you ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet me at the city gate to-morrow at midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The architect returned to Cologne, the image of the marvellous temple glowing
in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be immortal,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my name will never die. But,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;it is the price of my soul. No masses can help me, doomed, doomed forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told his strange story to his old nurse on his return home.</p>

<p>She went to consult the priest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said the priest to the old woman, &ldquo;to secure the design before
he signs the contract. As soon as he gets the plan into his hand let him present
to the old man, who is a demon, the relics of the martyrs and the sign of the
cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At midnight he appeared at the gate. There stood the little old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is your design,&rdquo; said the latter, handing him a roll of parchment.
&ldquo;Now you shall sign the bond that gives me yourself in payment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The architect grasped the plan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Satan, begone!&rdquo; he thundered; &ldquo;in the name of this cross, and of St.
Ursula, begone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast foiled me,&rdquo; said the old man, his eyes glowing in the darkness
like fire. &ldquo;But I will have my revenge. Your church shall never be completed,
and your name shall never be known in the future to mankind.&rdquo;</p>
</div>


<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;The Cathedral of Cologne is unfinished, and its architect&rsquo;s name
is unknown. It may harm the story, but it is but just to say that
many of the old cathedrals of Europe are in these respects like that
of Cologne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were impatient to visit the cathedral on our arrival at Cologne.
The structure stood as it were <em>over</em> the city, like its presiding
genius; and so it was. Wherever we went the great roofs loomed
above us in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The interior did not disappoint us, even after all we had seen in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
other cathedral towns. It was like a forest: the columns were like
tree stems of a vast open woodland, the groined arches appearing like
interweaving boughs. The gorgeous windows were like a sunset
through the trees. The air was dusky in the arches, but near the lofty
windows vivid with color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Sunday. The service had begun. It was like a pageant,
an opera. The organ was pouring a solemn chant through the far
arches, like fall winds among the trees. There was a flute-like gush of
music, far off and mysterious, like birds. It came from the boy-choristers.
Priests in glittering garments were kneeling before the cupola-crowned
altar; there rose a cloud of incense from silver censers, and
the organ thundered again, like the storm gathering over the woods.
At the side of the altar stood the archiepiscopal throne, half in shadow
amid the tall lights, red and gold; amid the piles of barbaric splendor,
canopies, carvings, emblems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We visited the chapels on the following day. In one of them a
Latin inscription tells the visitor,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Here repose the three bodies of the holy magi.</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The guide said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the tomb of the Three Kings of Cologne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Wise Men of the East who came to worship at the cradle at
Bethlehem.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ask him how he <em>got</em> them,&rsquo; said Willie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Empress Helena, mother of Constantine, recovered them
and sent them to Milan. When Frederick Barbarossa took the city of
Milan, he received them among the spoils and sent them to Cologne.
The names of the Magi were Gaspar, Melchior, Balthazar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you believe the legend?&rsquo; asked Willie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not know; we shall find things harder than this to believe,
I fancy, as we go on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we did.</p>

outskirts of the city found the famous Church of Skulls,&mdash;a gilded
ossuary, associated with a medi&aelig;val legend. It was full of cabinets
of bones, said to be those of eleven thousand virgins slain for their
faith by the Huns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we were shown&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>A part of the rod with which the Saviour was scourged.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>A thorn from the crown of thorns,&mdash;the Spicula.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The pitcher in which Jesus turned water into wine.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Medi&aelig;val Church,&rsquo; said our English-speaking guide, who
had little faith in the genuineness of the relics, &lsquo;has exhibited some
relics from time to time that would repay a long and arduous pilgrimage
if they were what they purported to be; as, for instance, a feather
of the angel Gabriel, the snout of a seraph, a ray from the star of
Bethlehem, <em>two</em> skulls of the same saint,&mdash;one taken when the departed
saint was somewhat younger, as flippantly explained to an astonished
tourist, who found in two cities the same consecrated cranium.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But of all the relics of which we ever read, some Germans who
visited Italy in search of these precious mementos received the most
remarkable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One of these gentlemen, having applied to an ecclesiastic for
some memento of Scripture history which he could take back to Germany,
was both astonished and delighted by receiving a carefully prepared
package, which he was assured contained a veritable leg of the
ass on which was made the triumphal entry into Jerusalem, when the
people strewed palm branches in the way and shouted hosannas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He was enjoined to keep the treasure a secret until he reached
home, which injunction he scrupulously obeyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Arriving in Germany, he disclosed to his four companions the
wonderful relic. They were much surprised, for each had been secretly
intrusted with the same remarkable treasure. So it appeared that the
ass had <em>five</em> legs, which, of itself, would have been something of a
miracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Whether these wiseacres ever visited the Latin kingdom in
search of relics again I am not apprised.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cologne is full of relics. The people regard them with reverence;
they serve the purpose of scriptural object-teaching to them.
But they only shock the tourist who has been educated to believe that
religion is a spiritual life, and that Christ&rsquo;s kingdom is a spiritual kingdom,
and not of this world.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpadt">Several of the stories related by the boys this evening were historical.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE STORY AND LEGEND OF CHARLEMAGNE.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Charles the Great, or Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Roman Emperor,
was born, probably at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 742. His empire at first embraced
the larger part of what is now France and Germany, but it extended under his
wars until at last it nearly filled Europe, and he wore the crown of Rome and
the West. Napoleon, at the height of his power, governed nearly the whole territory
that was once ruled by the mighty Charlemagne.</p>

<p>He was one of the greatest and wisest men in the history of the world. He
encouraged learning, and opened a school in his palace; he maintained morality
and aimed to spread Christianity throughout the world.</p>

<p>The Saxons were heathens. They honored a great idol called the Irmansaul.
They were opposed to Charlemagne, and constantly threatened his
frontiers.</p>

<p>Charlemagne invaded their country, overthrew the great image, and after
many struggles reduced the people to submission. In accordance with the rude
customs of the time, he compelled them to accept Christianity and receive baptism.
He is said to have baptized the prisoners of war with his own hand. He
divided Saxony into eight bishoprics, and supported the bishops with guards of
soldiers. We should look upon such missionary work as this as very questionable
to-day, although enlightened nations of this age have sometimes adopted a
policy in dealing with other countries that is as open to criticism and censure.</p>

<p>The Pope of Rome became involved in troubles with the Lombards. He
appealed for help to the victorious King of the Franks, the recognized champion
of the Church. Charlemagne crossed the Alps, conquered Lombardy, and
crowned himself with the iron crown of the ancient Lombard kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
He then repaired to Rome and entered the city in triumph. As he came to
St. Peter&rsquo;s he stooped to kiss the steps in memory of the illustrious men that
had trodden it before him. The Pope there received him in great ceremony,
and the choir chanted, &ldquo;Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He now became the most powerful monarch in the world. He gained great
victories over the Moors in Spain, and it was in one of the mountain passes
there that the chivalrous young Roland, of heroic song, perished. His lands
stretched from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In the year 800 he went to Rome. It was Christmas Day. He entered the
basilica of St. Peter&rsquo;s to attend Mass. He approached the altar, and bowed to
pray. The Pope secretly uplifted the crown of the world and placed it upon his
head.</p>

<p>The people shouted, &ldquo;<em>Long live Charles Augustus, crowned of God, Emperor
of the Romans!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>From this time Charlemagne was the Kaiser, or C&aelig;sar, of the Holy Roman
Empire on the Tiber and the Rhine.</p>

<p>The Rhine was loved by Charlemagne. He lived much on its borders, and
he was buried near it, in a church that he had founded, at Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<h4 class="smlpadt">THE STORY AND LEGEND OF BARBAROSSA.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Frederick of Germany was a very handsome man. There was a tinge of red
in his beard, and for that reason he came to be called Frederick Barbarossa.
He was an ambitious man, and he went to Rome to be crowned.</p>

It was a time of rival popes, and Barbarossa entered into the long controversy,
which would make a history of itself. He captured Milan, and levelled
the city. The sacred relics in the churches were sent to enrich the churches
of Germany. Among these were the reputed bodies of the three Wise Men of
the East; these were sent to Cologne, and are still exhibited there amid heaps
of jewels.</p>

<p>Barbarossa was constantly at war with popes and kings: he gained victories
and suffered reverses; but his career was theatrical and popular in those rude
times, and he was regarded as a very good monarch as kings went.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>He once held a great peace festival at Mentz, to which came forty thousand
knights. A camp of tents of silk and gold was set up by the Rhine, and musicians,
called minnesingers, delighted the nobles and ladies with songs of heroes
and knights. The songs and ballads then sung became famous, and this festival
may be said to be the beginning of musical art in music-loving Germany.</p>

<p>Europe was now startled with the news that the Saracens under Saladin
had taken Jerusalem. Barbarossa was about inaugurating a new war with the
Pope; but when this news came he and the Pope became reconciled, and he
resolved to go on a crusade.</p>

<p>He was an old man now, but he entered into the crusade with the fiery spirit
of youth. His war-cry was,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
&ldquo;Christ reigns! Christ conquers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He won a great victory at Iconium.</p>

<p>There was a swift, cold river near the battle-field, called Kaly Kadmus. A
few days after the victory, Barbarossa went into it to bathe. He was struck by
a chill and sank into the rapid current, and was drowned. He was seventy
years of age. His body was found and interred at Antioch.</p>

<p>Of course the Germans attached to Barbarossa a legend, as they do to everything.
They said that he was not dead, but had fallen a victim to enchantment.
He and his knights had been put to sleep in the Kyffhauser cave in Thuringia.
They sat around a stone table, waiting for release. His once red, but now white,
beard was growing through the stone.</p>

<p>They also said that the spell that bound Barbarossa and his knights would
some day be broken, and that they would come back to Germany. This would
occur when the country should be in sore distress, and need a champion for its
cause.</p>

<p>Ravens flew continually about the cave where the monarch and his knights
were held enchanted. When they should cease to circle about it, the spell would
be broken, and the grand old monarch would return to the Rhine.</p>

<p>They looked for him in days of calamity; but centuries passed, and he did
not return.</p>

<p>The legend is thus told in song:&mdash;</p>

<h3>HAMBURG.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">Hamburg.&mdash;Berlin.&mdash;Potsdam.&mdash;Palace of Sans-Souci.&mdash;Story of the Struggles
and Triumphs of Handel.&mdash;Story of Peter the Wild Boy.</p>


<p><span class="dcaph"><span class="dropcap">H</span></span>AMBURG, the fine old city of the Elbe, is almost as
large as was Boston before the annexation; it is
familiar by name to American ears, for it is from
Hamburg, as a port, that the yearly army of German
emigrants come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked sadly upon Hamburg as I thought
how many eyes filled with tears had turned back upon her spires and
towers, her receding harbor, and seen the Germany of their ancestors,
and the old city of Charlemagne, with its historic associations of a
thousand years, fade forever from view. Down the Elbe go the
steamers, and the emigrants with their eyes fixed on the shores!
Then westward, ho, for the prairie territories of the great empire of
the New World!</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than six thousand vessels enter the harbor of Hamburg in
a year. The flags of all nations float there, but the British red is
everywhere seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We visited the church of St. Michael, and ascended the steeple,
which is four hundred and thirty-two feet high, or one hundred feet
higher than the spire of St. Paul&rsquo;s in London. We looked down on
the city, the harbor, the canals. Our eye followed the Elbe on its way
to the sea. On the north was Holstein; on the south, Hanover.</p>

<p class="caption">CANAL IN HAMBURG.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Hamburg we made a zigzag to Berlin and Potsdam. The
railroad between the great German port and the brilliant capital is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
across a level country, the distance being about one hundred and
seventy-five miles, or seven hours&rsquo; ride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Berlin, capital of Prussia and of the German Empire, the residence
of the German Emperor, is situated in the midst of a vast plain;
&lsquo;an oasis of stone and brick in a Sahara of sand.&rsquo; It is about the size
of New York, and it greatly resembles an American city, for the
reason that everything there seems new.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been called a city of palaces, and so it is, for many of the
private residences would be fitting abodes for kings. The architecture
is everywhere beautiful; all the elegances of Greek art meet the
eye wherever it may turn. Ruins there are none; old quarters, none;
quaint Gothic or medi&aelig;val buildings, none. The streets are so regular,
the public squares so artistic, and the buildings such models of
art, that the whole becomes monotonous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is America over again,&rsquo; said an American traveller, who
had joined our party. &lsquo;Let us return.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many of the buildings might remind one of the hanging
gardens of old, so full are the balconies of flowers. The fronts of
some of the private residences are flower gardens from the ground
to the roofs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The emperor&rsquo;s palace is the crowning architectural glory of the
city. It is four hundred feet long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We visited the Zo&ouml;logical Gardens and the National Gallery of
Pictures, the entrance to which makes a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We rode to Potsdam, a distance of some twenty miles. Potsdam
is the Versailles of Germany. The road to Potsdam is a continuous
avenue of trees, like the roads near Boston.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course our object in visiting the town was to see the palace
and gardens of Sans-Souci, the favorite residence of Frederick the
Great.</p>

palace is by an avenue through gardens laid out in the Louis Quatorze
style, with alleys, hedges, statues, and fountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The famous palace stands on the top flight of a series of broad
terraces, fronted with glass. Beneath these terraces grow vines, olives,
and orange-trees. In the rear of the palace is a colonnade. There
Frederick used to pace to and fro in the sunshine, when failing health
and old age admonished him that death was near. As his religious
hopes were few, his reflections must have been rather lonely when
death&rsquo;s winter came stealing on.</p>

night at Hamburg on our return; then we made our way to the
steamer which was to take us to the Denmark of to-day, Copenhagen.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="hrpadt">Among the stories on the Hamburg Night was one by a music-loving
student of Yule, which he called</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE CITY OF HANDEL&rsquo;S YOUTH.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The composer of the &ldquo;Messiah,&rdquo; George Frederick Handel, was born at Halle,
Germany, Feb. 23, 1685. He sang before he could talk plainly. His father, a
physician, was alarmed, for he had a poor opinion of music and musicians. As
the child grew, nature asserted that he would be a musician; the father declared
he should be a lawyer.</p>

<p>Little George was kept from the public school, because the gamut was there
taught. He might go to no place where music would be heard, and no musical
instrument was permitted in the house.</p>

<p>But nature, aided by the wiser mother, triumphed. In those days musical
nuns played upon a dumb spinet, that they might not disturb the quiet of their
convents. It was a sort of piano, and the strings were muffled with cloth. One
of these spinets was smuggled into the garret of Dr. Handel&rsquo;s house. At night,
George would steal up to the attic and practise upon it. But not a tinkle could
the watchful father hear. Before the child was seven years of age he had taught
himself to play upon the dumb instrument.</p>

<p>One day Dr. Handel started to visit a son in the service of a German duke.
George begged to go, as he wished to hear the organ in the duke&rsquo;s chapel. But
not until he ran after the coach did the father consent.</p>

<p>They arrived at the palace as a chapel service was going on. The boy stole
away to the organ-loft, and, after service, began playing. The duke, recognizing
that it was not his organist&rsquo;s style, sent a servant to learn who was playing.
The man returned with the trembling boy.</p>

<p>Dr. Handel was both amazed and enraged. But the duke, patting the child
on the head, drew out his story. &ldquo;You are stifling a genius,&rdquo; he said to the
angry father; &ldquo;this boy must not be snubbed.&rdquo; The doctor, more subservient
to a prince than to nature, consented that his son should study music.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>During three years the boy studied with Zachau, the organist of the Halle
Cathedral. They were years of hard work. One day his teacher said to George,
&ldquo;I can teach you no longer; you already know more than I do. You must go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"><!-- illustration --></a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and study in Berlin.&rdquo; Berlin was at once attracted to the youthful musician by
his playing on the harpsichord and the organ. But the death of his father compelled
him to earn his daily bread. Willing to descend, that he might rise, he
became a violin player of minor parts at the Hamburg Opera House. The
homage he had received prompted his vanity to create a surprise. He played
badly, and acted as a verdant youth. The members of the orchestra sneeringly
informed him that he would never earn his salt. Handel, however, waited his
opportunity. One day the harpsichordist, the principal person in the orchestra,
was absent. The band, thinking it would be a good joke, persuaded Handel to
take his place. Laying aside his violin, he seated himself at the harpsichord,
amid the smiles of the musicians. As he touched the keys the smiles gave
place to looks of wonder. He played on, and the whole orchestra broke into
loud applause. From that day until he left Hamburg, the youth of nineteen led
the band.</p>

<p>Handel&rsquo;s extraordinary skill as a performer was not wholly due to genius.
He practised incessantly, so that every key of his harpsichord was hollowed like
a spoon.</p>

<p>Handel&rsquo;s greatest triumphs, as a composer, were won in England. But the
music-loving Irish of Dublin had the honor of first welcoming his masterpiece,
the &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo; Such was the enthusiasm it created that ladies left their hoops at
home, in order to get one hundred more listeners into the room.</p>

<p>A German poet calls the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; &ldquo;a Christian epic in musical sounds.&rdquo;
The expression is a felicitous description of its theme and style. It celebrates
the grandest of events with the sublimest strains that music may utter. The
great composer commanded, and all the powers of music hastened with song and
instrument to praise the life, death, and triumph of the Christ. No human composition
ever voiced, in poetry or prose or music, such a masterly conception of
the Virgin&rsquo;s Son as that uttered by this magnificent oratorio.</p>

<p>The sacred Scriptures furnish the words. The seer&rsquo;s prophecies, the Psalmist&rsquo;s
strains, the evangelist&rsquo;s narrative, the angels&rsquo; song, the anthem of the redeemed,
are transferred to aria, recitative, and chorus. The sentiment is as
majestic as the music is grand. He who sought out the fitting words had studied
his Bible, and he who joined to them musical sounds dwelt in the region of
the sublime.</p>

<p>All the emotions are touched by the oratorio. Words and music quiver
with fear, utter sorrow, plead with pathos, or exult in the joy of triumph. A
symphony so paints a pastoral scene that the shepherds of Bethlehem are seen
watching their flocks. One air, &ldquo;He was despised,&rdquo; suggests that its birth was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
amid tears. It was; for Handel sobbed aloud while composing it. It is the
threnody of the oratorio.</p>

<p>The grandeur of the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; finds its highest expression in the &ldquo;Hallelujah
Chorus.&rdquo; &ldquo;I did think,&rdquo; said Handel, describing, in imperfect English, his
thought at the moment of composition,&mdash;&ldquo;I did think I did see all heaven
before me, and the great God himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the oratorio was first performed in London, the audience were transported
at the words, &ldquo;The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.&rdquo; They all, with
George II., who happened to be present, started to their feet and remained
standing until the chorus was ended. This act of homage has become the
custom with all English-speaking audiences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have given the audience an excellent entertainment,&rdquo; said a patronizing
nobleman to Handel, at the close of the first performance of the &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;
in London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; replied the grand old composer, with dignity, &ldquo;I should be very
sorry if I only <em>entertained</em> them; I wish to make them <em>better</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few years before his death Handel was smitten with blindness. He continued,
however, to preside at his oratorios, being led by a lad to the organ,
which, as leader, he played. One day, while conducting his oratorio of &ldquo;Samson,&rdquo;
the old man turned pale and trembled with emotion, as the bass sung the blind
giant&rsquo;s lament: &ldquo;Total eclipse! no sun, no moon!&rdquo; As the audience saw the
sightless eyes turned towards them, they were affected to tears.</p>

<p>Seized by a mortal illness, Handel expressed a wish that he might die on
Good Friday, &ldquo;in hope of meeting his good God, his sweet Lord and Saviour,
on the day of his resurrection.&rdquo; This consolation, it seems, was not denied him.
For on his monument, standing in the Poets&rsquo; Corner of Westminster Abbey, is
inscribed: &ldquo;Died on Good Friday, April 14, 1759.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="hrpadt">Another story, which is associated with the woods of Hanover,
near Hamburg, was entitled</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">PETER THE WILD BOY.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>In the year 1725, a few years after the capture of Marie le Blanc, a celebrated
wild girl in France, there was seen in the woods, some twenty-five miles
from Hanover, an object in form like a boy, yet running on his hands and feet,
and eating grass and moss, like a beast.</p>

<p>The remarkable creature was captured, and was taken to Hanover by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
superintendent of the House of Correction at Zell. It proved to be a boy evidently
about thirteen years of age, yet possessing the habits and appetites of a
mere animal. He was presented to King George I., at a state dinner at Hanover,
and, the curiosity of the king being greatly excited, he became his patron.</p>

<p>In about a year after his capture he was taken to England, and exhibited to
the court. While in that country he received the name of Peter the Wild Boy,
by which ever after he was known.</p>

<p>Marie le Blanc, after proper training, became a lively, brilliant girl, and
related to her friends and patrons the history of her early life; but Peter the
Wild Boy seems to have been mentally deficient.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">PETER THE WILD BOY.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Dr. Arbuthnot, at whose house he resided for a time in his youth, spared no
pains to teach him to talk; but his efforts met with but little success.</p>

<p>Peter seemed to comprehend the language and signs of beasts and birds far
better than those of human beings, and to have more sympathy with the brute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
creation than with mankind. He, however, at last was taught to articulate the
name of his royal patron, his own name, and some other words.</p>

<p>It was a long time before he became accustomed to the habits of civilization.
He had evidently been used to sleeping on the boughs of trees, as a security
from wild beasts, and when put to bed would tear the clothes, and hopping up
take his naps in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>He regarded clothing with aversion, and when fully dressed was as uneasy
as a culprit in prison. He was, however, generally docile, and submitted to
discipline, and by degrees became more fit for human society.</p>

<p>He was attracted by beauty, and fond of finery, and it is related of him that
he attempted to kiss the young and dashing Lady Walpole, in the circle at court.
The manner in which the lovely woman received his attentions may be fancied.</p>

<p>Finding that he was incapable of education, his royal patron placed him in
charge of a farmer, where he lived many years. Here he was visited by Lord
Monboddo, a speculative English writer, who, in a metaphysical work, gives the
following interesting account:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in the beginning of June, 1782, that I saw him in a farmhouse
called Broadway, about a mile from Berkhamstead, kept there on a pension of
thirty pounds, which the king pays. He is but of low stature, not exceeding
five feet three inches, and though he must now be about seventy years of age,
he has a fresh, healthy look. He wears his beard; his face is not at all ugly or
disagreeable, and he has a look that may be called sensible or sagacious for a
savage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About twenty years ago he used to elope, and once, as I was told, he wandered
as far as Norfolk; but of late he has become quite tame, and either keeps
the house or saunters about the farm. He has been, during the last thirteen
years, where he lives at present, and before that he was twelve years with
another farmer, whom I saw and conversed with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This farmer told me he had been put to school somewhere in Hertfordshire,
but had only learned to articulate his own name, Peter, and the name of
King George, both which I heard him pronounce very distinctly. But the
woman of the house where he now is&mdash;for the man happened not to be home&mdash;told
me he understood everything that was said to him concerning the common
affairs of life, and I saw that he readily understood several things she said
to him while I was present. Among other things she desired him to sing
&lsquo;Nancy Dawson,&rsquo; which he accordingly did, and another tune that she named.
He was never mischievous, but had that gentleness of manners which I hold to
be characteristic of our nature, at least till we become carnivorous, and hunters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
or warriors. He feeds at present as the farmer and his wife do; but, as I was
told by an old woman who remembered to have seen him when he first came to
Hertfordshire, which she computed to be about fifty-five years before, he then
fed much on leaves, particularly of cabbage, which she saw him eat raw. He
was then, as she thought, about fifteen years of age, walked upright, but could
climb trees like a squirrel. At present he not only eats flesh, but has acquired
a taste for beer, and even for spirits, of which he inclines to drink more than he
can get.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old farmer with whom he lived before he came to his present situation
informed me that Peter had that taste before he came to him. He has also
become very fond of fire, but has not acquired a liking for money; for though
he takes it he does not keep it, but gives it to his landlord or landlady, which I
suppose is a lesson they have taught him. He retains so much of his natural
instinct that he has a fore-feeling of bad weather, growling, and howling, and
showing great disorder before it comes on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another philosopher, who made him a visit, obtained the following luminous
information:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is your father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pe-ter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is <em>that</em>?&rdquo; (pointing to a dog.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bow-wow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hanover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who found you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King George.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the year 1746 he ran away, and, entering Scotland, was arrested as
an English spy. His captors endeavored to force from him some terrible disclosure,
but could obtain nothing, not even an answer, and it was something of
a puzzle to them to determine exactly what they had captured.</p>

<p>They at last resolved to inflict punishment upon him for his obstinacy, but
were deterred by a lady who recognized him and disclosed his history.</p>

<p>In his latter years he made himself useful to the farmer with whom he lived,
but he required constant watchfulness, else he would make grave blunders. An
amusing anecdote is told of his manner of working when left to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
He was required, during the absence of his guardian, to fill a cart with compost,
which he did; but, having filled the cart in the usual way, and finding himself
out of employment, he directly shovelled the compost out again, and when
the farmer returned the cart was empty.</p>

<p>But poor Peter, with all his dulness, possessed some remarkable characteristics.
He was very strong of arm, and wonderfully swift of foot, and his senses
were acute. His musical gifts were most marvellous. He would reproduce, in
his humming way, the notes of a tune that he had heard but once,&mdash;a thing
that might have baffled an amateur.</p>

<p>He also had a lively sense of the beautiful and the sublime. He would
stand at night gazing on the stars as though transfixed by the splendors blazing
above. His whole being was thrilled with joy on the approach of spring. He
would sing all the day as the atmosphere became warm and balmy, and would
often prolong his melodies far into the beautiful nights.</p>

<p>He died aged about seventy years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE BELLS OF THE RHINE.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">Legends of the Bells of Basel and Speyer.&mdash;Story of the Harmony Chime.&mdash;The
Bell-founder of Breslau.</p>


<p><span class="dcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>NE evening, after the story-telling entertainments,
Mr. Beal was speaking to the Class of the great
bell of Cologne which has been cast from the
French cannon captured in the last war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems a beautiful thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the
guns of war should be made to ring out the notes
of peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one subject that we did not treat at our meetings,&rdquo; said
Charlie Leland,&mdash;&ldquo;the bells of the Rhine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Beal. &ldquo;A volume might be written on the subject.
Almost every belfry on the Rhine has its legend, and many of
them are associated with thrilling events of history. The raftmen, as
they drift down the river on the Sabbath, associate almost every bell
they hear with a story. The bells of Basle (Basel), Strasburg, Speyer,
Heidelberg, Worms, Frankfort, Mayence, Bingen, and Bonn all ring
out a meaning to the German student that the ordinary traveller does
not comprehend. Bell land is one of mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, the clocks of Basel. The American traveller
arrives at Basel, and hurries out of his hotel, and along the beautiful
public gardens, to the terrace overlooking the Rhine. He looks down
on the picturesque banks of the winding river; then far away his eye
seeks the peaks of the Jura.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
&ldquo;The bells strike. The music to his ears has no history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The German and French students hear them with different ears.
The old struggles of Alsace and Romaine come back to memory.
They recall the fact that the city was once saved by a heroic watchman,
who confused the enemy by causing the bells to strike the wrong
hour. To continue the memory of this event, the great bell of Basel
during the Middle Ages was made to strike the hour of one at noonday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bells of Speyer have an interesting legend. Henry IV. was
one of the most unfortunate men who ever sat upon a throne. His
own son, afterward Henry V., conspired against him, and the Pope
declared him an outlaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deserted by every one, he went into exile, and made his home at
Ingleheim, on the Rhine. One old servant, Kurt, followed his changing
fortunes. He died at Liege.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misfortune followed the once mighty emperor even after death.
The Pope would not allow his body to be buried for several years.
Kurt watched by the coffin, like Rizpah by the bodies of her sons.
He made it his shrine: he prayed by it daily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last the Pope consented that the remains of the emperor should
rest in the earth. The body was brought to Speyer. Kurt followed
it. It was buried with great pomp, and tollings of bells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some months after the ceremonious event Kurt died. As his
breath was passing, say the legendary writers, all the bells began to
toll. The bellmen ran to the belfries; no one was there, but the bells
tolled on, swayed, it was believed, by unseen hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry V. died in the same town. He was despised by the
people, and he suffered terrible agonies in his last hours. As his last
moments came the bells began to toll again. It was not the usual
announcement of the death of the good, but the sharp notes that proclaim
that a criminal is being led to justice; at least, so the people
came to believe.</p>

&ldquo;One of the most beautiful stories of bells that I ever met is associated
with a once famous factory that cast some of the most melodious
bells in Holland and the towns of the Rhine. I will tell it to
you.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE HARMONY CHIME.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Many years ago, in a large iron foundry in the city of Ghent, was found a
young workman by the name of Otto Holstein. He was not nineteen years of
age, but none of the workmen could equal him in his special department,&mdash;bell
casting or moulding. Far and near the fame of Otto&rsquo;s bells extended,&mdash;the
clearest and sweetest, people said, that were ever heard.</p>

<p class="caption">HOTEL DE VILLE, GHENT.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Of course the great establishment of Von Erlangen, in which Otto worked,
got the credit of his labors; but Von Erlangen and Otto himself knew very
well to whom the superior tone of the bells was due. The master did not pay
him higher wages than the others, but by degrees he grew to be general superintendent
in his department in spite of his extreme youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my bells are good,&rdquo; he said to a friend one day, who was commenting
upon their merits; &ldquo;but they do not make the music I will yet strike from
them. They ring alike for all things. To be sure, when they toll for a funeral
the slow measure makes them <em>seem</em> mournful, but then the notes are really the
same as in a wedding peal. I shall make a chime of bells that will sound at
will every chord in the human soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then wilt thou deal in magic,&rdquo; said his friend, laughing; &ldquo;and the Holy
Inquisition will have somewhat to do with thee. No human power can turn a
bell into a musical instrument.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can,&rdquo; he answered briefly; &ldquo;and, Inquisition or not, I will do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned abruptly from his friend and sauntered, lost in thought, down the
narrow street which led to his home. It was an humble, red-tiled cottage, of
only two rooms, that he had inherited from his grandfather. There he lived
alone with his widowed mother. She was a mild, pleasant-faced woman, and
her eyes brightened as her son bent his tall head under the low doorway, as he
entered the little room. &ldquo;Thou art late, Otto,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and in trouble, too,&rdquo;
as she caught sight of his grave, sad face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;When I asked Herr Erlangen for an increase of
salary, for my work grows harder every day, he refused it. Nay, he told me if
I was not satisfied, I could leave, for there were fifty men ready to take my
place. Ready! yes, I warrant they&rsquo;re ready enough, but to be <em>able</em> is a different
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother sighed deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt not leave Herr Erlangen&rsquo;s, surely. It is little we get, but it
keeps us in food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must leave,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Nay, do not cry out, mother! I have
other plans, and thou wilt not starve. Monsieur Dayrolles, the rich Frenchman,
who lives in the Linden-Strasse, has often asked me why I do not set up a
foundry of my own. Of course I laughed,&mdash;I, who never have a thaler to
spend; but he told me he and several other rich friends of his would advance
the means to start me in business. He is a great deal of his time at Erlangen&rsquo;s,
and is an enthusiast about fine bells. Ah! we are great friends, and
I am going to him after supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;People say he is crazy,&rdquo; said his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
&ldquo;Crazy!&rdquo; indignantly. &ldquo;People say that of everybody who has ideas they
can&rsquo;t understand. They say <em>I</em> am crazy when I talk of my chime of bells. If
I stay with Erlangen, he gets the credit of my work; but my chime must be
mine,&mdash;mine alone, mother.&rdquo; His eyes lighted with a kind of wild enthusiasm
whenever he talked on this subject.</p>

<p>His mother&rsquo;s cheerful face grew sad, as she laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Otto, thou art not thyself when thou speakest of those bells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More my real self, mother, than at any other time!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I only
truly live when I think of how my idea is to be carried out. It is to be my
life&rsquo;s work; I know it, I feel it. It is upon me that my fate is woven inextricably
in that ideal chime. It is God-sent. No great work, but the maker is
possessed wholly by it. Don&rsquo;t shake your head, mother. Wait till my &lsquo;Harmony
Chime&rsquo; sounds from the great cathedral belfry, and then shake it if
you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His mother smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou art a boy,&mdash;a mere child, Otto, though a wonderful genius, I must
confess. Thy hopes delude thee, for it would take a lifetime to carry out
thine idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let it take a lifetime!&rdquo; he cried out vehemently. &ldquo;Let me accomplish
it when I am too old to hear it distinctly, and I will be content that its
first sounds toll my dirge. I must go now to Monsieur Dayrolles. Wish me
good luck, dearest mother.&rdquo; And he stooped and kissed her tenderly.</p>

<p>Otto did not fail. The strange old man in his visits to the foundry had
noticed the germs of genius in the boy, and grown very fond of him. He was
so frank, so honest, so devoted to his work, and had accomplished so much at
his early age, that Monsieur Dayrolles saw a brilliant future before him. Besides,
the old gentleman, with a Frenchman&rsquo;s vanity, felt that if the &ldquo;Harmony
Chime&rdquo; <em>could</em> be made, the name of the munificent patron would go down to
posterity with that of the maker. He believed firmly that the boy would some
day accomplish his purpose. So, although the revolt of the Netherlands had
begun and he was preparing to return to his own country, he advanced the
necessary funds, and saw Otto established in business before he quitted Ghent.</p>

<p>In a very short time work poured in upon Otto. During that long and
terrible war the manufacture of cannon alone made the fortunes of the workers
in iron. So five years from the time he left Von Erlangen we find Otto Holstein
a rich man at twenty-four years of age. But the idea for which he
labored had never for a moment left his mind. Sleeping or waking, toiling or
resting, his thoughts were busy perfecting the details of the great work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thou art twenty-four to-day, Otto,&rdquo; said his good mother, &ldquo;and rich
beyond our hopes. When wilt thou bring Gertrude home to me? Thou hast
been betrothed now for three years, and I want a daughter to comfort my declining
years. Thou doest thy betrothed
maiden a grievous wrong
to delay without cause. The gossips
are talking already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them talk,&rdquo; laughed Otto.
&ldquo;Little do Gertrude or I care for
their silly tongues. She and I
have agreed that the &lsquo;Harmony
Chime&rsquo; is to usher in our marriage-day.
Why, good mother, no
man can serve two mistresses, and
my chime has the oldest claim.
Let me accomplish it, and then the
remainder of my life belongs to
Gertrude, and thou, too, best of
mothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still that dream! still that
dream!&rdquo; sighed his mother. &ldquo;Thou

to-day I have heard nothing more
of the wild idea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, because I needed money.
I needed time, and thought, too, to
make experiments. All is matured
now. I have received an order to
make a new set of bells for the great cathedral that was sacked last week by
the &lsquo;Iconoclasts,&rsquo; and I begin to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Otto had said, his life&rsquo;s work began the next day. He loved his
mother, but he seemed now to forget her in the feverish eagerness with which
he threw himself into his labors. He had been a devoted lover to Gertrude,
but he now never had a spare moment to give to her,&mdash;in fact, he only seemed
to remember her existence in connection with the peal which would ring in
their wedding-day. His labors were prolonged far over the appointed time, and
meanwhile the internal war raged more furiously, and the Netherlands were
one vast battle-field. No interest did Otto seem to take in the stirring events
around him. The bells held his whole existence captive.</p>

At last the moulds were broken, and the bells came out of their husks perfect
in form, and shining as stars in Otto&rsquo;s happy eyes. They were mounted
in the great belfry, and for the test-chime Otto had employed the best bell-ringers
in the city.</p>

<p>It was a lovely May morning; and, almost crazed with excitement and
anxiety, Otto, accompanied by a few chosen friends, waited outside the city for
the first notes of the Harmony Chime. At some distance he thought he could
better judge of the merits of his work.</p>

<p>At last the first notes were struck, clear, sonorous, and so melodious that his
friends cried aloud with delight. But with finger upraised for silence, and eyes
full of ecstatic delight, Otto stood like a statue until the last note died away.
Then his friends caught him as he fell forward in a swoon,&mdash;a swoon so like
death that no one thought he would recover.</p>

<p>But it was not death, and he came out of it with a look of serene peace on
his face that it had not worn since boyhood. He was married to Gertrude that
very day, but every one noticed that the ecstasy which transfigured his face
seemed to be drawn more from the sound of the bells than the sweet face
beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see a spell is cast on him as soon as they begin to ring?&rdquo; said
one, after the bells had ceased to be a wonder. &ldquo;If he is walking, he stops
short, and if he is working, the work drops and a strange fire comes in his
eyes; and I have seen him shudder all over as it he had an ague.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In good truth, the bells seemed to have drawn a portion of Otto&rsquo;s life to
them. When the incursions of the war forced him to fly from Ghent with his
family, his regrets were not for his injured property, but that he could not hear
the bells.</p>

<p>He was absent two years, and when he returned it was to find the cathedral
almost a ruin, and the bells gone no one knew where. From that moment a
settled melancholy took possession of Otto. He made no attempt to retrieve
his losses; in fact, he gave up work altogether, and would sit all day with his
eyes fixed on the ruined belfry.</p>

<p>People said he was melancholy mad, and I suppose it was the truth; but he
was mad with a kind of gentle patience very sad to see. His mother had died
during their exile, and now his wife, unable with all her love to rouse him from
his torpor, faded slowly away. He did not notice her sickness, and his poor
numbed brain seemed imperfectly to comprehend her death. But he followed
her to the grave, and turning from it moved slowly down the city, passed the
door of his old home without looking at it, and went out of the city gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
After that he was seen in every city in Europe at different intervals.
Charitable people gave him alms, but he never begged. He would enter a
town, take his station near a church and wait until the bells rang for matins or
vespers, then take up his staff and, sighing deeply, move off. People noting the
wistful look in his eyes would ask him what he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am seeking,&mdash;I am seeking,&rdquo; was his only reply; and those were almost
the only words any one ever heard from him, and he muttered them often to
himself. Years rolled over the head of the wanderer, but still his slow march
from town to town continued. His hair had grown white, and his strength
had failed him so much that he only tottered instead of walked, but still that
wistful seeking look was in his eyes.</p>

<p>He heard the old bells on the Rhine in his wanderings. He lingered long
near the belfries of the sweetest voices; but their melodious tongues only
spoke to him of his lost hope.</p>

<p>He left the river of sweet bells, and made a pilgrimage to England. It was
the days of cathedrals in their beauty and glory, and here he again heard the
tones that he loved, but which failed to realize his own ideal.</p>

<p>When a person fails to fulfil his ideal, his whole life seems a failure,&mdash;like
something glorious and beautiful one meets and loses, and never again finds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be true to the dreams of thy youth,&rdquo; says a German author; and every
soul is unhappy until the dreams of youth prove true.</p>

<p>One glorious evening in midsummer Otto was crossing a river in Ireland.
The kind-hearted boatman had been moved by the old man&rsquo;s imploring gestures
to cross him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mighty nigh his end, anyhow,&rdquo; he muttered, looking at
the feeble movements of the old pilgrim as he stumbled to his seat.</p>

<p>Suddenly through the still evening air came the distant sound of a melodious
chime. At the first note the pilgrim leaped to his feet and threw up his
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my God,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;found at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the bells of the Convent,&rdquo; said the wondering man, not understanding
Otto&rsquo;s words spoken in a foreign tongue, but answering his gesture. &ldquo;They
was brought from somewhere in Holland when they were fighting there.
Moighty fine bells they are, anyhow. But he isn&rsquo;t listening to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, he heard nothing but the bells. He merely whispered, &ldquo;Come back
to me after so many years,&mdash;O love of my soul, O thought of my life! Peal
on, for your voices tell me of Paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last note floated through the air, and as it died away something else
soared aloft forever, free from the clouds and struggles of life.</p>

His ideal was fulfilled now. Otto lay dead, his face full of peace and joy,
for the weary quest of his crazy brain was over, and the Harmony Chime had
called him to his eternal rest.</p>

<p>And, past that change of life that men call Death, we may well believe that
he heard in the ascension to the celestial atmosphere the ringing of welcoming
bells more beautiful than the Harmony Chime.</p>

<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;I will relate another story,&rdquo; said Mr. Beal. &ldquo;It is like the Harmony
Chime, but has a sadder ending.&rdquo;</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE BELL-FOUNDER OF BRESLAU.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>There once lived in Breslau a famous bell-founder, the fame of whose skill
caused his bells to be placed in many German towers. According to the ballad
of Wilhelm M&uuml;ller,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And all his bells they sounded<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So full and clear and pure:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He poured his faith and love in,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of that all men were sure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of all bells that ever<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He cast, was one the crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was the bell for sinners<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At Breslau in the town.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He had an ambition to cast one bell that would surpass all others in purity
of tone, and that should render his own name immortal.</p>

<p>He was required to cast a bell for the Magdalen Church tower of that city
of noble churches,&mdash;Breslau. He felt that this was opportunity for his masterpiece.
All of his thoughts centred on the Magdalen bell.</p>

<p>After a long period of preparation, his metals were arranged for use. The
form was walled up and made steady; the melting of the metals in the great
bell-kettle had begun.</p>

<p>The old bell-founder had two faults which had grown upon him; a love of
ale and a fiery temper.</p>

<p>While the metals were heating in the kettle, he said to his fire-watch, a
little boy,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tend the kettle for a moment; I am overwrought: I must go over to the
inn, and take my ale, and nerve me for the casting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, boy,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;touch not the stopple; if you do, you shall rue it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
That bell is my life, I have put all I have learned in life into it. If any man
were to touch that stopple, I would strike him dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">AT THE INN.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The boy had an over-sensitive, nervous temperament. He was easily excited,
and was subject to impulses that he could not easily control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
The command that he should not touch the stopple, under the dreadful
penalty, strongly affected his mind, and made him wish to do the very thing
he had been forbidden.</p>

<p>He watched the metal in the great kettle. It bubbled, billowed, and ran to
and fro. In the composition of the
glowing mass he knew that his master
had put his heart and soul.</p>

<p>It would be a bold thing to touch
the stopple,&mdash;adventurous. His
hand began to move towards it.</p>

<p>The evil impulse grew, and his
hand moved on.</p>

<p>He touched the stopple. The
impulse was a wild passion now,&mdash;he
turned it.</p>

<p>Then his mind grew dark&mdash;he
was filled with horror. He ran to
his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have turned the stopple; I
could not help it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
Devil tempted me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old bell-founder clasped his
hands and looked upward in agony.
Then his temper flashed over him.
He seized his knife, and stabbed the
boy to the heart.</p>

<p>He rushed back to the foundry,
hoping to stay the stream. He found
the metal whole; the turning of the
stopple had not caused the metal to
flow.</p>

<p>The boy lay dead on the ground.</p>

<p class="caption">THE DAY OF EXECUTION.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The old bell-founder knew the
consequences of his act, and he did
not seek to escape them. He cast
the bell; then he went to the magistrates, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My work is done; but I am a murderer. Do with me as you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trial was short; it greatly excited the city. The judges could not do
otherwise than sentence him to death. But as he was penitent, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
promised that on the day of his execution he should receive the offices and consolations
of the Church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But grant me another favor. My bells will
delight many ears when I am gone; my soul is in them; grant me another
favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name it,&rdquo; said the judges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I may hear the sound of my new bell before I die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judges consulted, and answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall toll for your execution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fatal day came.</p>

<p>Toll, toll, toll!</p>

<p>There was a sadness in the tone of the bell that touched every heart in
Breslau. The bell seemed human.</p>

<p>Toll, toll, toll!</p>

<p>How melodious! how perfect! how beautiful! The very air seemed
charmed! The years would come and go, and this bell would be the tongue
of Breslau!</p>

<p>The old man came forth. He had forgotten his fate in listening to the bell.
The heavy clang was so melodious that it filled his heart with joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is it! that is it; my heart, my life!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know all the
metals; I made the voice! Ring on, ring on forever! Ring in holy days, and
happy festivals, and joy eternal to Breslau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toll, toll, toll!</p>

<p>On passed the white-haired man, listening still to the call of the bell that
summoned him to death.</p>

<p>He bowed his head at the place of execution to meet the stroke just as the
last tone of the bell melted upon the air. His soul passed amid the silvery
echoes. The bell rings on.</p>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;Ay, of all bells that ever<br /></span>

the castles on the hills. The lords of the Rhine that once heard
them are gone forever. The vineyards creep up the hills on the light
trellises, and the sun and the earth, as it were, fill the grapes with
wine. The woods are as green as of old. The rafts go drifting down
the light waves as on feet of air. But the river of history is changed,

<p class="hrpadt">The narratives of the evening devoted to the Bells on the Rhine
were closed by a story by Master Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not often relate stories,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I have a German
story in mind, the lesson of which has been helpful to my experience.
It is a legend and a superstition, and one that is not as generally
familiar to the readers of popular books as are many that have been
told at these meetings. I think you will like it, and that you will
not soon forget it.&rdquo;</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">&ldquo;TO-MORROW.&rdquo;</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Once&mdash;many years, perhaps centuries ago&mdash;a young German student,
named Lek, was travelling from Leipsig to the Middle Rhine. His journey
was made on foot, and a part of it lay through the Thuringian Forest.</p>

<p>He rested one night at the old walled town of Saalfeld, visited the ruins of
Sorenburg, and entered one of the ancient roads then greatly frequented, but
less used now, on account of the shorter and swifter avenues of travel.</p>

<p>Towards evening he ascended a hill, and, looking down, was surprised to
discover a quaint town at the foot, of which he had never heard.</p>

<p>It was summer; the red sun was going down, and the tree-tops of the vast
forests, moved by a gentle wind, seemed like the waves of the wide sea. Lek
was a lover of the beautiful expressions of Nature, of the poetry of the forests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
hills, and streams; and he sat down on a rock, under a spreading tree, to see
the sunset flame and fade, and the far horizons sink into the shadows and
disappear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have made a good journey to-day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and whatever the strange
town below me may be, it will be safe for me to spend the night there. I see
that it has a church and an inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lek had travelled much over Germany, but he had never before seen a
town like the one below him. It wore an air of strange antiquity,&mdash;as a town
might look that had remained unchanged for many hundred years. An old
banner hung out from a quaint steepled building; but it was unlike any of
modern times, national or provincial.</p>

<p>The fires of sunset died away; clouds, like smoke, rose above them, and
a deep shadow overspread the forests. Lek gathered up his bundles, and
descended the hill towards the town. As he was
hurrying onward he met a strange-looking man in
a primitive habit,&mdash;evidently a villager. Lek
asked him the name of the place.</p>

<p>The stranger looked at him sadly and with
surprise, and answered in a dialect that he did
not wholly understand; but he guessed at the last
words, and rightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you wish to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a traveller,&rdquo; answered Lek, &ldquo;and I must
remain there until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To-morrow!</span>&rdquo; said the man, throwing up his
hands. &ldquo;To-morrow! For <em>us</em>,&rdquo; pointing to himself,
&ldquo;there is no to-morrow. I must hurry on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He strode away towards a faded cottage on
the outskirts of the town, leaving Lek to wonder
what his mysterious answer could mean.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Lek entered the town. The people were
strange to him; every one seemed to be in a
hurry. Men and women were talking rapidly, like
travellers when taking leave of their friends for
a long journey. Indeed, so earnest were their words that they seemed hardly
to notice him at all.</p>

<p>He presently met an old woman on a crutch, hurrying along the shadowy
street.</p>

&ldquo;Is this the way to the inn?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The old one hobbled on. He followed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the way to the inn? I wish to remain there until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cripple turned on her crutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To-morrow!</span>&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who are you that talk of to-morrow? All the
gold of the mountains could not buy a to-morrow. Go back to your own, young
man! they may have to-morrows; but my time is short,&mdash;I must hurry on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away hobbled the dame; and Lek, wondering at her answer, entered what
seemed to him the principal street.</p>

<p>He came at length to the inn; a faded structure, and antique, like a picture
of the times of old. There men were drinking and talking;
men in gold lace, and with long purses filled with
ancient coin.</p>

<p>The landlord was evidently a rich old fellow; he had
a girdle of jewels, and was otherwise habited much like
a king.</p>

<p>He stared at Lek; so did his jovial comrades.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you give a stranger hospitality until to-morrow?&rdquo;
asked the young student, bowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until <small>TO-MORROW</small>! Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed the innkeeper.
&ldquo;He asks for hospitality until to-morrow!&rdquo; he
added to his six jolly companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; echoed one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; repeated another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; chorused the others, slapping their
hands on their knees. &ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a solemn look came into the landlord&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you know, have you
not heard? <em>We</em> have no to-morrows; our nights are
long, long slumbers; each one is a hundred years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The six men were talking now, and the landlord
turned from Lek and joined in the conversation eagerly.</p>

<p>The shadows of the long twilight deepened. Men and women ran to and
fro in the streets. Every one seemed in a hurry, as though much must be said
and done in a brief time.</p>

<p>Presently a great bell sounded in a steeple. The hurrying people paused.
Each one uplifted his or her hands, waved them in a circle, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! <span class="smcap">To-morrow!</span> Hurry, good men, all, good women, all, hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
What did it mean? &ldquo;Have I gone mad?&rdquo; asked Lek. &ldquo;Am I dreaming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Near the inn was a green, parched and faded. In the centre was a withered
tree; under it was a maiden. She was very fair; her dress was of silk and
jewels, and on her arms were heavy bracelets of gold. Unlike the other people,
she did not seem hurried and anxious. She appeared to take little interest in
the strangely stimulated activities around her.</p>

<p>Lek went to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon a poor student seeking information,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your people all
treat me rudely and strangely; they will not listen to me. I am a traveller, and
I came here civilly, and only asked for food and lodging until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To-morrow!</span> The word is a terror to most of them; it is no terror to
me. I care not for to-morrows,&mdash;they are days of disappointments; I had them
once,&mdash;I am glad they do not
come oftener to me. I shall
go to sleep at midnight, here
where I was deserted. You
are a stranger, I see. You
belong to the world; every day
has its to-morrow. Go away,
away to your own people, and
to your own life of to-morrows.
This is no place for you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the bell sounded.
The hurrying people stopped
again in the street, and waved
their hands wildly, and cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haste, haste, good men,
all, good women, all. The hour
is near. Good men, all, good
women, all, hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>It was night now; but the
full moon rose over the long
line of hills, and behind it appeared a black cloud, from which darted tongues
of red flame, followed by mutterings of thunder.</p>

<p>The moon ascended the clear sky like a chariot, and the cloud seemed to
follow her like an army,&mdash;an awful spectacle that riveted Lek&rsquo;s gaze and made
him apprehensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A storm is coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must stay here. Tell me, good maiden,
where can I find food and shelter?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
&ldquo;Have you a true heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a true heart. I have always been true to myself; and he who is
true to himself is never unfaithful to God or his fellow-men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will be saved when the hour comes. They only go down with
us who are untrue. All true hearts have to-morrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moon ascended higher, and her light, more resplendent, heightened the
effect of the blackness of the rising
cloud. The lightnings became
more vivid, the thunder more distinct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure that your heart
is true?&rdquo; said the maiden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Cross, it is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I have a duty to do.
Follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose and walked towards
the hill from which Lek had
come. Lek followed her. As he
passed out of the town the bell
sounded: it was the hour of
eleven.</p>

<p>The people stopped in the
streets as before, waving their
hands, and crying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good men, all, good women,
all, hurry! The hour is near.
Good men, all, good women, all,
hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>The maiden ascended the hill to the very rock from which the student had
first seen the town, and under which he had rested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit you here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and do not leave the place until the cocks crow
for morning. A true heart never perished with the untrue. My duty is done.
Farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the tempest?&rdquo; said the student. &ldquo;This is no place of shelter. Let
me return with you, only until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There burst upon the hill a terrific thunder-gust. The maiden was gone,
the black cloud swept over the moon, and Lek could no longer discern the town
in the valley. Everything around him grew dark. The air seemed to turn into
a thick inky darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Fearful flashes of lightning and terrific thunder followed. The wind bent
the forest before it; but not a drop of rain fell.</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. The bell in the mysterious steeple smote
upon the air. It was midnight.</p>

<p>Another hush, as though Nature had ceased to breathe. Then a thunder-crash
shook the hills,
and seemed to cleave
open the very earth.</p>

<p>Lek crossed himself
and fell upon his
knees. The cloud
passed swiftly. The
moon came out again,
revealing the lovely
valley. <em>The village
was gone.</em></p>

<p>In the morning a
cowherd came up the
hill at the rising of the
sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morrow,&rdquo;
said Lek. &ldquo;That was
a fearful tempest that
we had at midnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard
such thunder,&rdquo; said
the cowherd. &ldquo;I almost
thought that the
final day had come.
You may well say it
was a fearful night, my boy.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>&ldquo;But what has become of the village that was in the valley yesterday?&rdquo;
asked Lek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no village in the valley,&rdquo; said the cowherd. &ldquo;There never was
but one. That was sunk hundreds of years ago; if you saw any village there
yesterday it was that: it comes up only once in a hundred years, and then it
remains for only a single day. Woe betide the traveller that stops there <em>that</em>
day. Unless he have a true heart, he goes down with the town at midnight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
The town was cursed because it waxed rich, and became so wicked that there
was found in it but one heart that was true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about this strange village,&rdquo; said Lek, in fear and awe, recalling his
adventure. &ldquo;I never before heard of a thing so mysterious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a sorry story. I will tell it as I have heard it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hills of Reichmanndorf used to abound with gold, and the people of
the old town all became rich; but their riches did not make them happy and
contented. It made them untrue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The more their wealth increased, the more unfaithful they became, until
the men met in the market-place daily to defraud each other, and the women&rsquo;s
only purpose in life was to display their vanity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the inn were nightly carousals. The young men thought only of their
gains and dissipations. Men were untrue to their families, and lovers to their
vows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sabbath was not kept. The old priest, Van Ness, said masses to the
empty aisles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In those evil days lived one Frederic Wollin. He was a brave man, and
his soul was true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the custom of this good man to instruct the people in the market-place.
But at last none came to hear him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, near Christmas, the council met. Wine flowed; rude jests went
round. The question was discussed as to how these days of selfish delights
might be made perpetual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great cry arose:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Banish the holy days: then all our to-morrows will be as to-day!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Wollin arose and faced the people. His appearance was met by a
tumult, and his words increased the hatred long felt against him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The days of evil have no to-morrows.&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;He that liveth to himself
is dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give him a holy day once in a hundred years!&rsquo; cried one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The voice was hailed with cheers. The council voted that all future days
should be as that day, except that Wollin and the old priest, Van Ness, should
have a holy day once in a hundred years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christmas came. No bell was rung; no chant was heard. Easter brought
flowers to the woods, but none to the altar. Purple Pentecost filled the forest
villages with joy; but here no one cared to recall the descent of the celestial
fire except the old priest and Wollin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was such a night as last night when Van Ness and Wollin came out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
the church for the last time. The people were drinking at the inn, and dancing
upon the green. Spring was changing into deep summer; the land was filled
with blooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A party of young men who had been carousing, on seeing Wollin come
from the church, set upon him, and compelled him to leave the town. He came
up this hill. When he had reached the top, he paused and lifted his face
towards heaven, and stretched out his hand. As he did so, a sharp sound rent
the valley, and caused the hills to tremble. He looked down. The village had
disappeared. Only Van Ness was standing by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But as the villagers had promised Wollin a holy day once in a hundred
years, so once in a hundred years these people are permitted to rise with
their village into the light of the sun for a single day. If on that day a stranger
visits them whose heart is untrue he disappears with them at midnight. Such
is the story. You will hardly believe it true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The student crossed himself, and went on his journey towards the Rhine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>They</em> have one day in a hundred years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How precious must
that one day be to them! If I enter the ways of evil, and my heart becomes
untrue, shall <em>I</em> have <em>one</em> day in one hundred years when life is ended and my
account to Heaven is rendered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thought. He read the holy books. He tried to find a single hope for
an untrue soul; but he could discover none.</p>

<p>Then he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The days of evil have no to-morrows,&mdash;no, not once in a hundred years.
Only good deeds have to-morrows. I will be true: so shall to-morrows open
and close like golden doors until time is lost in the eternal.&rdquo; And his heart
remained true.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE SONGS OF THE RHINE.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">The Watchman&rsquo;s Song.&mdash;The Wild Hunt of L&uuml;tzow.&mdash;The Author of the Erl
King.&mdash;Beethoven&rsquo;s Boyhood.&mdash;The Organ-Tempest of Lucerne.</p>


<p><span class="dcapr"><span class="dropcap">R</span></span>HINELAND is the land of song. It is the wings
of song that have given it its fame. Every town
on the Rhine has its own songs; every mountain,
hill, and river.</p>

<p>America has few local songs,&mdash;few songs of
the people. The singers who give voices to rivers,
lakes, mountains, and valleys have not yet appeared. The local poets
and singers of America are yet to come.</p>

<p>In England, Germany, and some of the provinces of France, every
temple, stream, and grove has had its sweet singer.</p>

<p>Go to Basle, and you may hear the clubs singing the heroic songs
of Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p>Go to Heidelberg, and you may listen to student-songs through
which breathe the national spirit of hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The bands tell the story, legend, or romance of such towns at night,
wherever they may play.</p>

<p>In one of the public grounds to which the Class went for an evening
rest, one of the bands was playing the <i>Fremersberg</i>.</p>

<p>It related an old romance of the region of Baden-Baden: how that
a nobleman was once wandering with his dogs in the mountains, and
was overtaken by a storm; how he was about to perish when he heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the distant sounds of a monastery bell; how, following the direction
of the sound, he heard a chant of priests; and how, at last, he was
saved.</p>

<p>The piece was full of melody. The wind, the rain, the horns, the
bells, the chant, while they told a story, were all delightfully melodious.</p>

<p>The ballad is almost banished from the intellectual American
concert-rooms. In Germany a ballad is a gem, and is so valued. It
is the best expression of national life and feeling.</p>

<p>The Class went to hear one of Germany&rsquo;s greatest singers. She
sang an heroic selection, and was recalled. Her first words on the
recall hushed the audience: it was a ballad of the four stages of life.
It began with an incident of a child dreaming under a rosebush:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Sweetly it sleeps and on dream wings flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To play with the angels in Paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the years glide by.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>as an English translation gives it.</p>

<p>In the last stanza, the child having passed through the stages of
life, was represented as again sleeping under a rosebush. The withered
leaves fall upon his grave.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Withered and dead they fall to the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silently cover a new-made mound,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the years glide by.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>These last lines were rendered so softly, yet distinctly, that they
seemed like tremulous sounds in the air. The singer&rsquo;s face hardly
appeared to move; every listener was like a statue. The silence was
almost painful and impressive. One could but feel this was indeed
art, and not a pretentious affectation of it.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">AN OLD GERMAN TOWN.</p>

<p>The reign of the organ as the monarch of musical instruments
began with Charlemagne, and nearly all of the towns on the Rhine
have historic organs. Many of the organ pieces are local compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"><!-- illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and imitative. On the great organs at Basle and Frieburg the
imitation of storms is sometimes produced.</p>

<p>None of these storm-pieces, however, equal that which is daily
played in summer on the organ of Lucerne. This organ tempest
more greatly excited the Class than any music that they heard during
their journeys; and Master Beal made a record of it in verse, which
we give at the close of the chapter.</p>

<p>The children of Germany learn to read music at the same age that
they learn to read books. Music
is a part of their primary
school&mdash;Kindergarten&mdash;education.
The poorest children
are taught to sing.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE RHINEFELS.</p>

<p>The consequence is that the Germans are a nation of singers.
The organ is a power in the church, the military band at the festival,
and the ballad in the concert-room and the home.</p>

<p>These ballad-loving people are familiar with the best music. To
them music is a language. Says Mayhew, in his elaborate work on
the Rhine, in speaking of the free education in music in Germany:
&ldquo;To tickle the gustatory nerves with either dainty food or drink costs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
some money; but to be able to reproduce the harmonious combinations
of a Beethoven or a Weber, or to make the air tremble melodiously
with some sweet and simple ballad, or even to recall the sonorous
solemnities of some prayerful chorus or fine thanksgiving in an oratorio,
is not only to fill the heart and brain with affections too deep
for words, but it is to be able to taste as high a pleasure as the soul
is capable of knowing, and yet one that may be had positively for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that so much of the good music of Germany
is performed in the beer-gardens. The too free use of the glass and
the pipe cannot tend to make the nation strong for the future; and
one cannot long be charmed with the music and mirth of such places
without fearing for the losses that may follow.</p>

<p>All trades and occupations have their own songs, even the humblest.
Take for example the pleasing Miller&rsquo;s Song, which catches the
spirit of his somewhat poetic yet homely calling:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To wander is the miller&rsquo;s joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To wander!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What kind of miller must he be,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p class="author smcap">Wilhelm M&uuml;ller.</p>

<p class="smlpadt">The watchman, too, has his peculiar songs. One of these is very
solemn and stately. A favorite translation of it begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hark ye, neighbors, and hear me tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Eight</em> now strikes the loud church bell.&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p class="hrpadt">The Class devoted an autumn evening to singing the songs of the
Rhine; the &ldquo;Watch on the Rhine,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Loreley,&rdquo; the student-songs,
folk-songs, and some of the chorals of Luther. The song that proved
most inspiring was the &ldquo;Wild Chase of L&uuml;tzow.&rdquo; Master Beal
awakened a deep interest in this song before it was sung, by relating
its history.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">&ldquo;THE WILD HUNT OF L&Uuml;TZOW.&rdquo;</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>All musical ears are familiar with the refrain: &ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;tis the hunt of L&uuml;tzow
the free and the bold,&rdquo;&mdash;if not with these exact words, with other words of
the same meaning. The music of C. M. Von Weber has carried the &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; of
L&uuml;tzow over the world. The song and music alike catch the spirit and the
movement of a corps of cavalry bent on the destruction of an enemy. One
sees the flying horsemen in the poem, and hears them in the music. It was
one of the few martial compositions that starts one to one&rsquo;s feet, and stirs one&rsquo;s
blood with the memory of heroic achievements.</p>

<p>I will give you one of the most vigorous translations. Longfellow has
adopted it in his &ldquo;Poems of Places.&rdquo; It catches the spirit of the original, and
very nearly reproduces the original thought.</p>

<p>L&uuml;tzow, the cavalry hero of Prussia, in the German war for freedom against
the rule of Napoleon, was born in 1782. He was a famous hunter, and when
Europe arose against Bonaparte in 1813, he called for volunteers of adventurous
spirit for cavalry service: &ldquo;hunters&rdquo; of the enemy, who should hang about the
French army, and, with the destructive vigilance of birds or beasts of prey,
give the enemy no rest on the German side of the Rhine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
The boldest young men of Germany rushed to L&uuml;tzow; noblemen, students,
foresters. His corps of cavalry became the terror of the French army.
The enemy could never tell where they would be found.</p>

<p>Among the young volunteers was K&ouml;rner, the young German poet. He
was a slender young man; but he had an heroic soul, and the cavalry corps of
the fiery L&uuml;tzow seemed to him the place for it. He joined the &ldquo;wild hunters&rdquo;
in 1813.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Germany rises,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Prussian eagle beats her wings; there is
hope of freedom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what happiness can fruit for me in life; I know that the star of
fortune shines upon me; but a mighty feeling and conviction animates me: no
sacrifice can be too great for my country&rsquo;s freedom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words glow.</p>

<p>He added,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must forth,&mdash;I must oppose my breast to the storm. Can I celebrate
the deeds of others in song, and not dare with them the danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>K&ouml;rner&rsquo;s battle-songs became firebrands. He consecrated himself to his
country in the village church near Zobten. He wrote the battle-hymn for the
occasion, which was a service for the departing volunteers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We swore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the oath of fidelity to our cause. I fell upon my
knees and implored God&rsquo;s blessing. The oath was repeated by all, and the
officers swore it on their swords. Then Martin Luther&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Mighty Fortress
is our God&rsquo; concluded the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wrote a thrilling war-song on the morning of the battle of Danneberg,
May 12, 1813. It ended with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hark! hear ye the shouts and the thunders before ye?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On, brothers, on, to death and to glory!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We&rsquo;ll meet in another, a happier sphere!&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p>On May 28, 1813, Major Von L&uuml;tzow determined to set out on an expedition
towards Thuringia, with his young cavalry and with Cossacks. K&ouml;rner
begged to accompany him. L&uuml;tzow commissioned him as an officer. He was
wounded, and left for a time helpless in a wood, on the 17th of June. In this
condition he wrote his famous &ldquo;Farewell to Life.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;My deep wound burns,&rdquo; &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>K&ouml;rner recovered, but was suddenly killed in an engagement on August
26th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
The &ldquo;Sword Song&rdquo; of K&ouml;rner which Von Weber&rsquo;s music has made famous,
was written a few hours before his death. It was an inspiration to the German
cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;L&uuml;tzow&rsquo;s Wild Chase&rdquo; thrilled Prussia. Like the &ldquo;Watch on the Rhine&rdquo;
in the recent war, it was the word that fired the national pride, and nerved men
to deeds that crowned the cause with glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rhine! the Rhine!&rdquo; shouted the young German heroes at last, looking
down on the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a battle?&rdquo; asked the officers, dashing on in the direction of the
shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the enemy has gone over the Rhine,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;The Rhine!
the Rhine!&rdquo;</p>
</div>


<p class="hrpadt">Mr. Beal introduced a number of selections from German composers,
the loved tone-poets, with interesting stories and anecdotes.
We reproduce a part of these musical incidents, as they properly
belong to the history of the river of song.</p>

<p>Taking up a selection from Schubert&rsquo;s famous symphony, he spoke
feelingly of the author, and then gave some pictures of the lives of
Beethoven and Bach.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE AUTHOR OF THE ERL KING.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Poor Schubert! The composer of what operas, symphonies, overtures,
choruses, masses, cantatas, sonatas, fantasias, arias! What tenderness was in
his soul!&mdash;Listen to the &ldquo;Last Greeting;&rdquo; what fancy and emotion! listen to
the &ldquo;Fisher Maiden&rdquo; and &ldquo;Post Horn;&rdquo; what refinement! listen to the &ldquo;Serenade;&rdquo;
what devotion! hear the &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Dead at the age of thirty-one; dead after a life of neglect, leaving all these
musical riches behind him!</p>

<p>Franz Schubert was born at Himmelpfortgrand, in 1797. His father was a
musician, but a poor man. Franz was placed at the age of eleven among the
choir-boys of the Court Chapel, where he remained five years, absorbed in
musical studies, and making himself the master of the leading instruments of
the orchestra.</p>

<p>To compose music was his life. His restless genius was ever at work;
always seeking to produce something new, something better. The old masters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and especially Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, were his sources of study and
inspiration. Music became his world, and all outside of it was strange and
unexplored. All of his moods found expression in music: his love, his hopes,
his wit, his sadness, and his dreams.</p>

<p>He seems to have composed his best works for the pure love of his art, with
little thought of money or fame. Many of his best works he never heard performed.
He left his manuscript scores scattered about his rooms, and so they
were found in confusion after his decease.</p>

<p>A monument was erected to his memory. On it is the following simple but
touching inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The art of music buried here a rich possession, but yet far fairer hopes. Franz Schubert
lies here. Born on the 30th of January, 1797, died on the 19th of November, 1828, thirty-one
years old.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Fame almost failed to overtake him in life; his course was so rapid, and his
works were so swiftly produced. It crowned his memory.</p>

<p>Schubert&rsquo;s magnificent symphony in C is one of the most beautiful works
of the kind ever written, and lovers of orchestral music always delight to find it
on the programme of an evening concert. It is a charm, an enchantment; it
awakens feelings that are only active in the soul under exceptional influences.
Yet the listener does not know to what he is listening: it is all a mystery; no
one can tell what the composer intended to express by this symphony. We
know that the theme is a noble one,&mdash;but what? that the soul of the writer
must have been powerfully moved during its composition,&mdash;by what influences?
It is an enigma: each listener may guess at the theme, and each will associate
it with the subject most in harmony with his own taste.</p>

<p>In 1844 Robert Schumann, while looking over a heap of dusty manuscripts
at Vienna, found this wonderful symphony, until then unknown. He was so
much charmed with it that he sent it to Mendelssohn at Leipzig. It was there
produced at the Gewandhaus concerts, won the admiration it deserved, and
thence found its way to all the orchestras of the world. The youthful composer
had been dead nearly twenty years when the discovery was made.</p>

<p>One of the best known of the dramatic German ballads is the Erl King.</p>

<p>The Erl King is Death. He rides through the night. He comes to a
happy home, and carries away a child, galloping back to the mysterious land
whence he came.</p>

<p>In this ballad a father is represented as riding with a dying child under his
cloak. The Erl King pursues them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Schubert gave the ballad its musical wings. I need not describe the music.
It is on your piano. Let it tell the story.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="smlpadt">BEETHOVEN&rsquo;S BOYHOOD AT BONN.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Literary men have often produced their best works late in life. Longfellow
cites some striking illustrations of this truth in <i>Morituri Salutamus</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;It is too late! Ah, nothing is too late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the tired heart shall cease to palpitate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cato learned Greek at eighty; Sophocles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrote his grand &OElig;dipus, and Simonides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore off the prize of verse from his compeers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When each had numbered more than fourscore years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Theophrastus, at fourscore and ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had but begun his Characters of Men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chaucer, at Woodstock with the nightingales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sixty wrote the Canterbury Tales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goethe at Weimar, toiling to the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Completed Faust when eighty years were past.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such examples of late working are seldom found in musical art. Men seem
to become musicians because of the inspiration born within them. This impelling
force is very early developed.</p>

<p>Handel, the greatest musical composer of his own or any age, was so devoted
to music in childhood that his father forbade his musical studies. At the age
of eleven he as greatly delighted and surprised Frederick I. of Prussia by his
inspirational playing; he was in youth appointed to a conspicuous position of
organist in Halle.</p>

<p>Haydn surprised his friends by his musical talents at his <em>fifth</em> year. He
had a voice of wonderful purity, sweetness, and compass, and was received as a
choir-boy at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Church, Vienna.</p>

<p>Mozart&rsquo;s childhood is a household story. He was able to produce chords on
the harpsichord at the age of three, and wrote music with correct harmonies at
the age of six. Gl&uuml;ck had made a musical reputation at the age of eighteen.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn was a brilliant pianist at six, and gave concerts at nine. Verdi
was appointed musical director at Milan in youth. Rossini composed an opera
at the age of sixteen, and ceased to compose music at forty.</p>

<p>No other art exhibits such remarkable developments of youthful genius;
though many eminent poets like Pindar, Cowley, Pope, Mrs. Hemans, L. E. L.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
have written well in early youth. Music is a flower that blossoms early, and
bears early fruit.</p>

<p>Music may justly be called the art of youth.</p>

<p>Beethoven was born at Bonn on
the Rhine, 1770. He lived here
twenty-two years. His musical
character was formed here.</p>

<p>Beethoven was put at the harpsichord
at the age of four years.
He was able to play the most difficult
music in every key at twelve
years; and was appointed one of
the court organists when fifteen.</p>

<p>The boy received this appointment,
which was in the chapel of
the Elector of Cologne, by the influence
of Count Waldstein, who
had discovered his genius. Here
he was the organ prince.</p>

<p>The following curious anecdote
is told of his skill at the organ:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the last three days of the
passion week the Lamentations of
the Prophet Jeremiah were always
chanted; these consisted of passages
of from four to six lines, and
they were sung in no particular
time. In the middle of each sentence,
agreeably to the old choral
style, a <em>rest</em> was made upon one
note, which rest the player on the
piano (for the organ was not used
on those three days) had to fill up
with a voluntary flourish.</p>

<p class="caption">BEETHOVEN&rsquo;S HOME AT BONN.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>&ldquo;Beethoven told Heller, a singer at the chapel who was boasting of his
professional cleverness, that he would engage, that very day, to put him out, at
such a place, without his being aware of it, so that he should not be able to
proceed. He accepted the wager; and Beethoven, when he came to a passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
that suited his purpose, led the singer, by an adroit modulation, out of the
prevailing mode into one having no affinity with it, still, however, adhering to
the tonic of the former key; so that the singer, unable to find his way in this
strange region was brought to a dead stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exasperated by the laughter of those around him, Heller complained to
the elector, who (to use Beethoven&rsquo;s expression) &lsquo;gave him a most gracious
reprimand, and bade him not play any more such clever tricks.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Bonn young Beethoven devoted himself almost wholly to the organ.
The memories of the Rhine filled his life, which ended so sadly on the Danube.
Bonn and Beethoven are as one name to the English or American tourist.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE FATHER OF ORGAN MUSIC.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Bach, the greatest organist and composer of organ music of the last century,
was born at Eisenach, 1685, and had truly a remarkable history. His art
was born in him. He wrote because he must write, and sung because he must
sing.</p>

<p>His father was a court musician, and had a twin brother who occupied the
same situation, and so much resembled him that their wives could not tell them
apart. These twin brothers produced music nearly alike; their dispositions
were identical; when one was ill, the other was so likewise, and both died at
the same time.</p>

<p>John Sebastian Bach was the brightest ornament of this music-loving family.
His parents died in his boyhood, and his musical education was undertaken by
his eldest brother, a distinguished organist. He fed on music as food.</p>

<p>An incident will show his spirit. He was eager to play more difficult music
than his brother assigned. He noticed that his brother had a book of especially
difficult pieces; and he begged to be allowed to use it, but was denied. This
book was kept locked in a cupboard, which had an opening just wide enough to
admit the boy&rsquo;s thin hand. He was able to reach it, and, by rolling it in a certain
way, to bring it out and replace it without unlocking the door. He began
to copy it by moonlight, as no candle was allowed him in the evening, and in
six months had reproduced in this manner the whole of the music. About this
time his brother died, and the friendless lad engaged himself as a choir-singer,
which gave him a temporary support.</p>

<p>Organ-music became a passion with him. He determined, at whatever sacrifice,
to make himself the master of the instrument. He might go hungry, lose
the delights of society; but the first organist in Germany he would be: nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
should be allowed to stand in the way of this purpose in life. He studied
all masters. He made a long journey on foot to Lubeck to hear a great German
master play the organ; and when he heard him, he remained three months
an unknown and secret auditor in the church.</p>

<p>A youth in which a single aim governs life early arrives at the harvest.
Young manhood found Bach court organist in that Athens of Germany, Weimar.
His fame grew until it reached the ears of Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Bach has come,&rdquo; joyfully said the King to his musicians, on learning
that the great organist arrived in town.</p>

<p>He became blind in his last years, as did Handel. Ten days before his
death his sight was suddenly restored, and he rejoiced at seeing the sunshine
and the green earth again. A few hours after this strange occurrence, he was
seized with an apoplectic fit. He died at the age of sixty-eight.</p>

<p>His organ-playing was held to be one of the marvels of Germany. He
made the organ as it were a part of his own soul; it expressed his thoughts
like an interpreter, and swayed other hearts with the emotions of his own. His
oratorios and cantatas were numbered by the hundred, many of which were produced
only on a single occasion. His most enduring work is the Passion
Music.</p>

<p>In 1850 a Bach Society was formed in London, and a revival of the works
of the master followed. Bach wrote five passions, but only one for two choirs.</p>

<p>To the general audience much of the Passion music, as arranged for English
choral societies, seems too difficult for appreciation; but the over-choir at the
beginning, the expression of suffering and darkness, and the so-called earthquake
choruses, with its sudden and stupendous effects, impress even the
uneducated ear.</p>

<p>The beauty and power of the oratorio as a work of art are felt in proportion
to one&rsquo;s musical training; but as a sublime tone-sermon, all may feel its force,
and dream that the awful tragedy it represents is passing before them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>COPENHAGEN.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">Copenhagen.&mdash;The Story of Ancient Denmark.&mdash;The Royal Family.&mdash;Story of
a King who was out into a Bag.</p>


<p><span class="dcapo"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>N the Denmark Night Mr. Beal gave a short introductory
talk on Copenhagen, and several of the
boys related stories by Hans Christian Andersen.
Master Lewis gave some account of the early history
of Denmark and of the present Royal Family;
and Herman Reed related an odd story of one of
the early kings of Denmark.</p>


<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;Copenhagen, or the Merchants&rsquo; Haven, the capital of the island
kingdom of Denmark, rises out of the coast of Zealand, and breaks
the loneliness and monotony of a long coast line. It was a beautiful
vision as we approached it in the summer evening hours of the high
latitude,&mdash;evening only to us, for the sun was still high above the
horizon. The spire of the Church of Our Saviour&mdash;three hundred
feet high&mdash;appeared to stand against the sky. Palaces seemed to
lift themselves above the sea as we steamed slowly towards the great
historic city of the North.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The entrance to the harbor is narrow but deep. The harbor
itself is full of ships; Copenhagen is the station of the Danish navy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We passed very slowly through the water streets among the
ships of the harbor,&mdash;for water streets they seemed,&mdash;and after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
tedious landing, were driven through the crooked streets of a strange
old town to a quiet hotel where some English friends we had met on
the Continent were stopping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The city is little larger than Providence, Rhode Island. Its
public buildings are superb. It is an intellectual city, and its libraries
are the finest of Europe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is divided into two parts, the old town and the new. In the

<p>&ldquo;We visited the Rosenborg Palace, the old residence of the Danish
kings;&mdash;it is only a show palace now. In the church we saw
Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s statues of the Twelve Apostles, regarded as the finest
of his works.</p>

<h4 class="smlpadt">THE STORY OF ANCIENT DENMARK.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>It is a strange, wild romance, the early history of the nations of the North.</p>

<p>The Greeks and Romans knew but little about the Scandinavians. They
knew that there was a people in the regions from which came the north winds.
The north wind was very cold. Was there a region beyond the north wind? If
so, how lovely it must be, where the cold winds never blow. They fancied that
there was such a region. They called the inhabitants Hyperboreans, or the
people beyond the north wind. They imagined also that in this region of eternal
summer men did not die. If one of the Hyperboreans became tired of earth,
he had to kill himself by leaping from a cliff.</p>

<p>The Northmen, or the inhabitants of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, were
of the same origin as the tribes that peopled Germany, and that came from the
East, probably from the borders of the Black Sea. They were fire-worshippers,
and their chief god was Odin.</p>

<p>Denmark means <em>a land of dark woods</em>. In ancient times it was probably
covered with sombre firs. One of its early kings was Dan the Famous. His
descendants were called Danes.</p>

<p>Many ages after the reign of this king, the land was filled with peace and
plenty. It was the Golden Age of the North. Frode the Peaceful was king in
the Golden Age. He ruled over all lands from Russia to the Rhine, and over
two hundred and twenty kingdoms of two hundred and twenty subjugated kings.
There was no wrong, nor want, nor thieves, nor beggars in the Golden Age.
This happy period of Northern history was at that age of the world when Christ
was born.</p>

<p>According to the Scalds, the god Odin used to appear to men. He appeared
the last time at the battle of Bravalla, a contest in which the Frisians, Wends,
Finns, Lapps, Danes, Saxons, Jutes, Goths, and Swedes all were engaged. The
dead were so thick on the field, after this battle, that their bodies reached to the
axle-wheels of the chariots of the victors. At the time of this battle Christianity
was being proclaimed in England. It was approaching the North. With
the battle of Bravalla the mythic age of Denmark and the North comes to
an end.</p>

<p>I have told you something of Louis le Debonnaire, who went to die on a rock
in the Rhine, that the waters might lull him to his eternal repose. He was a
missionary king, and he desired nothing so much as the conversion of the world
to Christ. He was the son of Charlemagne. &ldquo;It is nobler to convert souls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
than conquer kingdoms&rdquo; was his declaration of purpose. He sent missionary
apostles to the North to convert Denmark. His missions at first were failures,
but in the end they resulted in giving all the Northern crowns to Christ&rsquo;s kingdom,
that Louis loved more than his own.</p>

<p>The Danes in the Middle Ages became famous sea-kings. Before England,
Denmark ruled the sea. One stormy day in December Gorm the Old appeared
before Paris with seven hundred barks. He compelled the French king to sue
for peace.</p>

<p>The sea-kings conquered England. Canute the Dane was king of all the
regions of the northwest of Europe. His kingdom embraced Denmark, England,
Sweden, Norway, Scotland, and Cumberland. Such is the second wonderful
period of Denmark&rsquo;s history.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE ROYAL FAMILY OF DENMARK.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>Royal people, as well as &ldquo;self-made men,&rdquo; often undergo remarkable changes
of fortune. No one, however high or low, is free from the accidents of this
world. All men have surprises, either good or bad, in store for them.</p>

<p>Few families have experienced a more striking change in position than the
present royal house of the little northern kingdom of Denmark. Twenty years
ago, the present king, Christian IX., was a rather poor and obscure gentleman,
of princely rank, to be sure, residing quietly in Copenhagen, and bringing up his
fine family of boys and girls in a very domestic and economical fashion. He
was only a remote cousin of Frederick VII., the reigning monarch, and he
seemed little likely to come to the throne.</p>

<p>But death somewhat suddenly prepared the way for him, so that when old
Frederick died, in 1863, Christian found himself king.</p>

<p>This, however, was but the beginning of the fortunes of this once modest
and little-known household. Just before Christian came to the throne, his eldest
daughter, Alexandra, a beautiful and an amiable girl, attracted the attention of
the Prince of Wales. The prince became attached to her, and in due time married
her.</p>

<p>About the same time, Christian&rsquo;s second son, George, was chosen King of
Greece, and was crowned at Athens, and is still reigning there.</p>

<p>After three years had passed, the second daughter, Maria Dagmar, who, like
her sister Alexandra, was a very lovely and attractive girl, was married to the
Czarowitch Alexander of Russia, after having been betrothed to his elder brother
Nicholas, who died. She is now Empress of Russia.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Somewhat later, the eldest son of the Danish king married the only daughter
of Oscar II., King of Sweden and Norway, thus forming a new link of
national friendship between the three Scandinavian nations.</p>

<p>It is thus quite possible that in the not distant future no less than four of
King Christian&rsquo;s children, who were brought up with little more expectation
than that of living respectably and wedding into Danish noble families, will
occupy thrones in Europe. It may happen that the two daughters will share
two of the greatest of those thrones,&mdash;that one will be Queen of England; the
other is Empress of Russia,&mdash;while the two sons will be respectively King of
Denmark and King of Greece.</p>

<p>This great good fortune, in a worldly point of view, which has come to the
Danish royal family, cannot certainly be attributed solely, or even mainly, to
luck or chance. It has been, after all, chiefly its virtues which have won it such
a high position in Europe. The good breeding and excellent character of the
king&rsquo;s children have won for them the prominence they now hold; for the daughters
are as womanly and virtuous as they are physically attractive, and the sons
are models of manly bearing and irreproachable habits.</p>
</div>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE STORY OF A KING WHO WAS PUT INTO A BAG.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>&ldquo;His realm was once a cradle, and now it is a coffin,&rdquo; might be said of the
most powerful monarch that ever lived. Kings are but human, and they are
pitiable objects indeed when they fall from their high estate into the power of
their enemies. Never did a king present a more humiliating spectacle in his
fall than Valdemar II., called the Conqueror.</p>

<p>Under the early reign of this king, the Golden Age seemed to have returned
to Denmark. Never was a young monarch more prosperous or glorious in so
narrow a kingdom.</p>

<p>His empire grew. He annexed Pomerania. He wrested from the German
Empire all the territories in their possession north of the Elbe and Elde, and he
finally became the master of Northern Germany.</p>

<p>He was a champion of the Church. A papal bull conceded to him the sovereignty
of all the people he might convert, and he entered the field against the
pagans of Esthonia, with an army of 60,000 men, and 1,400 ships! He baptized
the conquered with kingly pomp and pride.</p>

<p>His reign was now most splendid. Denmark was supreme in Scandinavia
and Northern Germany. The Pope revered the Danish power, and the world
feared it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
But secret foes are often more dangerous than open enemies. The conquered
princes of Germany hated him, and planned his downfall.</p>

<p>Among these was the Count-Duke of Schwerin. He pretended great respect
and affection for Valdemar. He laid many snares for the king&rsquo;s ruin, but they
failed. He was called &ldquo;Black Henry&rdquo; in his own country on account of his dark
face and evil nature, and Valdemar had been warned against him as a false
friend.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">THE KING IN THE BAG.</p>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>But he was warm, obsequious, and fascinating to the king, and the king
liked him.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1233 Valdemar invited him to hunt with him in the woods
of Lyo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the king I am disabled and cannot leave my couch,&rdquo; said the artful
count, who now thought of a way to accomplish his long-cherished purpose.</p>

<p>He left his couch at once, and sent his spies to shadow the king.</p>

<p>The king landed at Lyo with only a few attendants.</p>

<p>One night the king was sleeping in the woods of Lyo in a rude, unguarded
tent. His son was by his side.</p>

<p>They were awaked from slumber by an assault from unknown foes, and a
sense of suffocation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
What had happened? The king could not move his arms; his head seemed
enveloped in cloth. He could not see; his voice was stifled. He <em>felt</em> himself
carried away.</p>

<p>Black Henry had entered the tent with his confidants, and had put the King
of the North and his son into two bags, and tied them up, and was now hurrying
away with them to the river.</p>

<p>Black Henry laid his two captives in the bottom of a boat like two logs,
and hoisted sail; and Valdemar, whose kingdom was now only a bag, was blown
away towards the German coast.</p>

<p>He was thrown into prison, and there lived in darkness and neglect. The
Pope ordered his release, but it was not heeded. The Danes tried to rescue
him, but were defeated.</p>

<p>He was at last set free on the agreement that he should pay a large ransom.
He returned to his kingdom, but found his territory reduced to its old narrow
limits. His glory was gone. His empire had been the North; it had also been
a bag; and at last it was a coffin. Poor old man! His last years were peaceful,
and in them he served Denmark well.</p>

<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;Strange is the evolution of cities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are about to glance at Stockholm. Let

<p>&ldquo;There are some rocky islands in the Baltic, at the foot of the
northern peninsula. Sea birds wheel above them in the steel-gray
air; they build their nests there. Storms sweep over these lonely
islands; sunlight bursts upon them, and now and then a Viking&rsquo;s ship
finds a haven among them, and scares away the birds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Years pass. Fishermen build huts on the islands. Hunters
come there. There come also the sea kings. A mixed, strange
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They build a village on the holms, or islets. They defend themselves
with stockades, and they found on stocks, or beams, their strong
houses. The growing town rises from stock holms; hence, Stockholm.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The years pass, and the sea birds fly away. There are wings of
gables where once were wings of birds. Stockholm becomes a fortress,
and, as in the case of St. Petersburg in recent times, the sea

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
desolation pulses with life and energy, and is transformed into a city.
Churches, palaces, gardens, arise. Battles are fought, and here tread
the feet of kings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wonder grows. The birds scream far away now. The
islands are spanned by bridges. Stockholm stands a splendid city,
one of the crowns of earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The city lies before us. Noble structures, villas, steeples, are seen
among the green trees. The ships of many flags lie together like a
town in the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is sunset. The tops of the linden-trees are crowned with sunlight,
the Gothic windows burn. A shadow falls from the gray sky.
Afar fly the white sea-gulls. The shadow deepens. It is night. We
are in Stockholm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every nation has its hero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been told how that poor Louis le Debonnaire, the son
of Charlemagne, preferred to win crowns for Christ&rsquo;s kingdom rather
than for his own. He lost his own kingdom; but the missionaries he
sent forth, though at first not successful, were the means of giving
Christianity to all the nations of the North.</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">THE HERO KING OF SWEDEN.</h4>

<div class="smlfont">
<p>There was born in Stockholm, in 1594, an heir to the Swedish throne, whose
influence was destined to be felt throughout the world and to very distant
periods of time. The child was named Gustavus Adolphus.</p>

<p>He was educated for the kingdom. At the age of ten he was made to
attend the sittings of the Diet and the councils of state. In boyhood he was
able to discuss state affairs in Latin, and in youth he was able to speak nearly
all European tongues.</p>

<p>He was schooled in the arts of war as well as peace. In early manhood he
entered Russia at the head of an army, and compelled the Czar to sue for
peace.</p>

<p>After the war the young king gave his whole heart to the development of
the industries and institutions of his kingdom. He founded schools, assisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
churches, and everywhere multiplied influences for good. Never did a monarch
devote himself more earnestly to the improvement of his people, or accomplish
more in a short time. His influence for good has ever lived in Sweden, and is
felt strongly to-day.</p>

<p>He was an ardent Protestant. The Catholic powers of the South and the
Protestant powers of the North had become very hostile, and war between them
seemed impending. In this crisis the Protestant leaders looked to Gustavus
Adolphus as the champion of their cause.</p>

<p>In 1630 Gustavus called a Diet in Stockholm, and reported the danger that
was threatening the Protestant states of Germany, and which would involve
Sweden unless checked. He announced that he had decided to espouse the
cause of the German princes, and to enter the field. He took his little daughter
in his arms, and commended her to the Diet as the heir to the crown.</p>

<p>He landed in Germany on Midsummer&rsquo;s day in 1630. He had an army of
fifteen thousand men. It was a small army indeed for so perilous an undertaking.
&ldquo;<i>Cum Deo et victricibus armis</i> is my motto,&rdquo; he declared, and trusting in
this watchword he advanced on his dangerous course.</p>

<p>The Imperialists, as the foes of the Reformed Faith were called, were led by
Wallenstein. They were greatly superior in numbers to the Swedes and their
allies.</p>

<p>At Lutzen the great battle of Protestantism was fought, Nov. 6, 1632.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I truly believe that the Lord has given my enemies into my hands,&rdquo; said
Gustavus, just before the battle.</p>

<p>The morning dawned gray and gloomy. A heavy mist hung over the two
armies.</p>

<p>The Swedish and German army united in singing Luther&rsquo;s hymn,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg ist unser Gott.&rdquo;<br /></span>

<p>Clad in his overcoat without armor, he mounted his horse and rode along the
lines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The enemy is within your reach,&rdquo; he said to the allies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swedes,&rdquo; he said to his old army, &ldquo;if you fight as I expect of you, you
shall have your reward; if not, not a bone of your bodies will ever return to
Sweden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the Germans he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you fail me to-day, your religion, your freedom, and your welfare in this
world and in the next are lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He prophesied to the Germans,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust in God; believe that with his help you may this day gain a victory
which shall profit your latest descendants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waved his drawn sword over his head and advanced.</p>

<p>The Swedes and Finns responded with cheers and the clash of arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jesus, Jesus, let us fight this day for thy name,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The whole army was now in motion, the king leading amid the darkness and
gloom of the mist.</p>

<p>The battle opened with an immediate success for the Swedes. But in the
moment of victory the king was wounded and fell from his horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The king is killed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The report was like a death-knell to the Swedes, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s horse with an empty saddle was seen galloping wildly down the
road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead us again to the attack,&rdquo; the leaders demanded of George of Saxe-Weimar.</p>

<p>The spirit of the dead king seemed to infuse the little army with more than
human valor. The men fought as though they were resolved to give their lives
to their cause. The memory of the king&rsquo;s words in the morning thrilled them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Nothing could stand before such heroism. Pappenheim fell. The Imperialists
were routed. The Swedes at night, victorious, possessed the field, but they had
lost the bravest of kings, and one of the most unselfish of rulers.</p>

<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;We left Stockholm for Upsala, the student city. The paddles of
the boat brushed along the waters of the M&auml;lar; the old city retreated
from view, and landscape after landscape of variegated beauty rose
before us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The M&auml;lar Lake is margined with dark pines, bright meadows
and fields, light green linden-trees, gray rocks, and shadowy woods.
Here and there are red houses among the lindens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We pass flat-bottomed boats, that dance about in the current
made by the steamer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hills of Upsala come into view. The University next
appears, like a palace; then a palace indeed, red like the houses;
then the gabled town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We went to the church, and were conducted into a vaulted chamber
where were crowns and sceptres taken from the coffins of dead
kings. We wandered along the aisle after leaving the treasure-room
of the dead, and gazed on cold tombs and dusty frescos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here sleeps Gustavus Vasa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the centre aisle, under a flat stone, lies the great botanist,
Linn&aelig;us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We visited the garden of Linn&aelig;us, or the place where it once
bore the blossoms and fruits of the world. Nettles were there; the
orangeries were gone; the winter garden had disappeared. The
place wore a desolate look; the master had departed, leaving little
there but the ghost of a great memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We left Stockholm for Norway.</p>

Lazaretto, or pest-house, on a high rock, from which we felt sure that
no disease would ever be communicated.</p>

<p class="caption">LAZARETTO.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The scenery of Norway is unlike any other in the world. Take
the map and scan the western coast. It looks like a piece of lace-work,
so numerous are the inlets or fiords.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These fiords are many of them surrounded by headlands as high
as mountain walls. They are little havens, with calm water of wondrous
beauty and with walls that seem to reach to the sky. On a
level spot in the mountainous formation, a hamlet or a little church is
sometimes seen, one of the most picturesque objects with its setting
in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
[The artist can give one a better view of these fiords than any
description, and he has faithfully done it here.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mountains and valleys of Norway are unlike any other.
Summer finds them as winter leaves them. Great hills are worn into
cones by the snow and ice. The cataracts are numerous and wonderful.
The water scenery has no equal for romantic beauty and
wildness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A twelve hours&rsquo; farther sail brought us to Christiania. It is
situated in a lovely valley on the northern side of Christiania Fiord.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
It has a population of about eighty thousand. Here are the Royal
Palace and University.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of the cities of the North have great schools and libraries.
The University at Christiania has nearly a thousand students, and a
library of one hundred and fifty thousand books.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The port is covered with ice during some four months in the
year. During the mild seasons some two thousand vessels yearly
enter the harbor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olaf, the Saint, the King of &lsquo;Norroway,&rsquo; who preached the Gospel
&lsquo;with his sword,&rsquo; is the hero of the western coast. I might relate
many wonderful stories of him, but I would advise you to read &lsquo;The
Saga of King Olaf,&rsquo; by Longfellow, in the &lsquo;Wayside Inn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His capital was Drontheim, far up among the northern regions,
where the sun shines all night in summer, and where the winters are
wild and dreary, cold and long. It is a quaint old town. Summer
tourists to the western coast of Norway sometimes visit it. Its cathedral
was founded by Olaf, and is nearly a thousand years old.</p>


<p class="hrpadt">&ldquo;And now in ten nights&rsquo; entertainments, you have taken hasty
views of Germany and the old Kingdom of Charlemagne. Narratives
of travel and history have been mingled with strange traditions and
tales of superstition; all have combined to give pictures of the ages
that are faded and gone, and that civilization can never wish to recall.
Men are reaching higher levels in religion, knowledge, science, and
the arts. Kingcraft is giving way to the governing intelligence of
the people, and superstition to the simple doctrines of the Sermon
on the Mount and to the experiences of a spiritual life. The age of
castles and fortresses, like churches, is gone. The age of peace and
good-will comes with the fuller light of the Gospel and intelligence.
The pomps of cathedrals will never be renewed. The Church is coming
to teach that character is everything, and that the soul is the
temple of God&rsquo;s spiritual indwelling.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>THE GREATER RHINE.</h3>

<p class="chapsub">The Return Homeward.&mdash;On the Terrace,&mdash;Quebec.</p>


<p><span class="dcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE Class made their return voyage by the way of
Liverpool to Quebec, one of the shortest of the
ocean ferries, and one of the most delightful in midsummer
and early autumn, when the Atlantic is
usually calm, and the icebergs have melted away.</p>

<p>As the steamer was passing down the Mersey,
and Liverpool with her thousands of ships, and Birkenhead with its
airy cottages, were disappearing from view, Mr. Beal remarked to the
boys,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall return through the Straits, and so shall be probably
only four and a half days out of sight of land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not suppose it was possible to cross the Atlantic from land
to land in four days and a half,&rdquo; said Charlie Leland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall stop to-morrow at Moville, the port of Londonderry,&rdquo;
said Mr. Beal. &ldquo;A few hours after we leave we shall sink the Irish
coast. Make notes of the time you lose sight of the light-houses of
Ireland, and of the time when you first see Labrador, and compare
the dates towards the end of the voyage,&rdquo; said Mr. Beal.</p>

<p>Past the green hills of Ireland the steamer glided along, among
ships so numerous that the sea seemed a moving city, or the suburbs
of a moving city; for Liverpool itself, with her seven miles of wonderful
docks, is a city of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
The Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, the sunny port of Moville, the rocky
islands with their white light-houses, were passed, and at one o&rsquo;clock
on Monday morning the last light dropped into the calm sea, fading
like a star.</p>

<p>The Atlantic was perfectly calm&mdash;as &ldquo;calm as a mill-pond&rdquo; as the
expression is, during the tranquillity of the ocean that follows the settled
summer weather. The steamer was heavily loaded, and had little
apparent motion; bright days and bright nights succeeded each other.
A flock of gulls followed the steamer far out to sea. For three days
no object of interest was seen on the level ocean except the occasional
spouting of a whale.</p>

<p>The sky was a glory in the long twilights. The sun when half set
made the distant ocean seem like an island of fire, and the light clouds
after sunset like hazes drifting away from a Paradisic sphere.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning the shadowy coast of Labrador appeared.
The voyage seemed now virtually ended after four days from land to
land. There were three days more, but the steamer would be in calm
water, with land constantly in view.</p>

<p>The Straits of Belle Isle, some six miles wide, were as calm as had
been the ocean. The Gulf of St. Lawrence&mdash;the fishing field of the
world&mdash;was like a surface of glass. The sunrise and moonrise were
now magnificent; the sunsets brought scenes to view as wonderful as
the skies of Italy; gigantic mountains rose; clustering sails broke the
monotonous expanse of the glassy sea, and now and then appeared
an Indian canoe such as Jacques Cartier and the early explorers saw
nearly three centuries ago.</p>

<p>The wild shores of Anticosti rose and sunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are now in the Greater Rhine,&rdquo; said Mr. Beal to the boys,&mdash;&ldquo;the
Rhine of the West.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asked Charlie Leland. &ldquo;Is not the Hudson the
American Rhine?&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">NIAGARA FALLS.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the New York Rhine,&rdquo; said Mr. Beal, smiling. &ldquo;The river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"><!-- illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
St. Lawrence is, by right of analogy, the American Rhine, and so deserves
to be called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is the larger river?&rdquo; asked Charlie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The larger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not seem possible that an American schoolboy could
seriously ask such a question! I am sometimes astonished, however,
at the ignorance that older people of intelligence show in regard to
our river of which all Americans should be proud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ours is the Greater Rhine. The German Rhine is less than a
thousand miles long; our Rhine is nearly twenty-five hundred miles
long: the German Rhine can at almost any point be easily spanned
with bridges; our Rhine defies bridges, except in its narrowest boundaries.
The great inland seas of Superior, Huron, Michigan, Ontario,
and Erie require a width of miles for their pathway to the ocean.
The Rhine falls cannot be compared with Niagara, nor the scattered
islands of the old river with the Lake of a Thousand Islands of the
new. Quebec is as beautiful as Coblentz, and Montreal is in its situation
one of the loveliest cities of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tributaries of the old Rhine are small; those of the new are
almost as large as the old Rhine itself,&mdash;the gloomy Saguenay, and
the sparkling Ottawa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of its lakes! Lake Ladoga, the largest lake in Europe,
contains only 6,330 square miles. Lake Superior has 32,000 square
miles, and Michigan 22,000 square miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will soon have a view of the mountain scenery of the lower
St. Lawrence. The pine-covered walls along which trail the clouds
of the sky are almost continuous to Montreal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; asked Charlie Leland, &ldquo;is the German Rhine so
famous, and ours so little celebrated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The German Rhine gathers around it the history of two thousand
years; ours, two hundred years. What will our Rhine be two
thousand years from to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
He added:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look upon New England as one of the best products of civilization
thus far. But there is rising a new New England in the West,
a vast empire in the States of the Northwest and in Canada, to which
New England is as a province,&mdash;an empire that in one hundred years
will lead the thought, the invention, and the statesmanship of the
world. Every prairie schooner that goes that way is like a sail of
the &lsquo;Mayflower.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In yonder steerage are a thousand emigrants. The easy-going,
purse-proud cabin passengers do not know it; they do not visit them
or give much thought to them: but there are the men and women
whose children will one day sway the empire that will wear the crown
of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The castles are fading from view on the hills of the old Rhine;
towns and cities are leaping into life on the new. The procession of
cities, like a triumphal march, will go on, on, on. The Canadian Empire
will probably one day lock hands with the imperial States of the
Northwest; Mexico, perhaps, will join the Confederacy, and Western
America will doubtless vie with Eastern Russia in power, in progress,
and in the glories of the achievements of the arts and sciences. Our
Rhine has the future: let the old Rhine have the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Class approached Quebec at night. The scene was beautiful:
like a city glimmering against the sky, the lights of the lower town,
of the upper town, and of the Castle standing on the heights, shone
brightly against the hills; and the firing of guns and the striking of
bells were echoed from the opposite hills of the calm and majestic
river.</p>

<p>The Class spent a day at Quebec, chiefly on the Terrace,&mdash;one of
the most beautiful promenades in the world. From the Terrace the
boys saw the making up of the emigrant trains on the opposite side
of the river, where the steamer had landed, and saw them disappear
along the winding river, going to the great province of Ontario, the
lone woods of Muskoka, and the far shores of the Georgian Bay.</p>

&ldquo;I wish we might make a Zigzag journey on the St. Lawrence,&rdquo;
said Charlie Leland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And collect the old legends, stories, and histories of the Indian
tribes, and the early explorers and French settlers,&rdquo; added Mr. Beal.
&ldquo;Perhaps some day we may be able to do so. I am in haste to return
to the States, but I regret to leave a place so perfectly beautiful as the
Terrace of Quebec. It is delightful to sit here and see the steamers
go and come; to watch the bright, happy faces pass, and to recall the
fact that the river below is doubtless to be the water-path of the nations
that will most greatly influence future times. But our journey
is ended: let us go.&rdquo;</p>


<h4 class="smlpadt">ON THE TERRACE,&mdash;QUEBEC.</h4>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alone, beside these peaceful guns<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I walk,&mdash;the eve is calm and fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below, the broad St. Lawrence runs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Above, the castle shines in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o&rsquo;er the breathless sea and land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night stretches forth her jewelled hand.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Amid the crowds that hurry past&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bright faces like a sunlit tide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some eyes the gifts of friendship cast<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon me, as I walk aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind, wordless welcomes understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spirit&rsquo;s touch of brotherhood.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Below, the sea; above, the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Smile each to each, a vision fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So like Faith&rsquo;s zones of light on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A sphere seraphic seems the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loving thoughts there seem to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come and go with golden feet.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Below me lies the old French town,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With narrow rues and churches quaint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And til&egrave;d roofs and gables brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And signs with names of many a saint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there in all I see appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart of twice an hundred years.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond, by inky steamers mailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Point Levi&rsquo;s painted roofs arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where emigration long has hailed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The empires of the western skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightly wave the red flags there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like roses of the damask air.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Peace o&rsquo;er yon garden spreads her palm,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where heroes fought in other days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Honor speaks of brave Montcalm<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On Wolfe&rsquo;s immortal shaft of praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What lessons that I used to learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In schoolboy days to me return!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair terrace of the Western Rhine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I leave thee with unwilling feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I long shall see thy castle shine<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As bright as now, in memories sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cheerful thank the kindly eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lent to me their sympathies.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Go, friendly hearts, that met by chance<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A stranger for a little while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friendship itself is but a glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And love is but a passing smile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a pilgrim,&mdash;all I meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are glancing eyes and hurrying feet.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Farewell; in dreams I see again<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The northern river of the vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While crowns the sun with golden grain<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The hillsides of the greater Rhine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here shall grow as years increase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The empires of the Rhine of Peace.<br /></span>
